iii</span>REVISER&rsquo;S NOTE</h2>
<p>The continuance of Bayard Taylor&rsquo;s Library of Travel in
the popular favor is one of the accepted facts of the literary
world.&nbsp; So much so, indeed, that a revision of his works on
the part of another is to be permitted only on certain conditions
of reserve, and by reason of events that have transpired since
the death of the distinguished traveller.</p>
<p>Travellers and authors die; but the tribes, nations, and races
visited by them continue on, making war or peace, changing
frontiers, setting up or pulling down dynasties.</p>
<p>The whole political complexion of a country may be changed in
a decade.&nbsp; Though the people of Arabia, the genuine
Bedouins, are believed to have changed little or nothing in their
mode of life since the days of the Shepherd Kings of
Abraham&rsquo;s time, waves of political and religious agitation
have occasionally rippled over one part or another of the ancient
peninsula.&nbsp; Seemingly they make as little permanent
impression on the undercurrent of Bedouin life, as do the waves
of the sea on its immutable whole, so that the accounts of the
earlier chroniclers of Arabian life and manners agree in a
singular manner with the descriptions of contemporary
visitors.&nbsp; For this reason, no less than for the respect and
admiration <a name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iv</span>entertained by the reviser for Mr. Taylor&rsquo;s
conscientiousness and judgment as a traveller and compiler, and
his literary excellence as an author, this volume remains,
practically, as fully the work of its original editor as
before.</p>
<p>By way of bringing it up to date, however, Chapter XVII. has
been added, and such slight revision of preceding chapters has
been made as was found necessary, consistent with the scope and
intention of the new edition.</p>

I.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Sketch of Arabia: Its
Geographical Position, and Ancient History</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Peninsula of Arabia, forming
the extreme southwestern corner of Asia, is partly detached, both
in a geographical and historical sense, from the remainder of the
continent.&nbsp; Although parts of it are mentioned in the oldest
historical records, and its shores were probably familiar to the
earliest navigators, the greater portion of its territory has
always remained almost inaccessible and unknown.</p>
<p>The desert, lying between Syria and the Euphrates is sometimes
included by geographers as belonging to Arabia, but a line drawn
from the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Euphrates (almost
coinciding with the parallel of 30&deg; N.) would more nearly
represent the northern boundary of the peninsula.&nbsp; As the
most southern point of the Arabian coast reaches the latitude of
12&deg; 40&prime;, the greater part of the entire territory, of
more than one million square miles, lies within the
tropics.&nbsp; In shape it is an irregular rhomboid, the longest
diameter, from Suez to the Cape <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>El-Had, in Oman, being 1,660, and from
the Euphrates to the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, 1,400 miles.</p>
<p>The entire coast region of Arabia, on the Red Sea, the Indian
Ocean, and the Gulfs of Oman and Persia, is, for the most part, a
belt of fertile country, inhabited by a settled, semi-civilized
population.&nbsp; Back of this belt, which varies in width from a
few miles to upwards of a hundred, commences a desert table-land,
occasionally intersected by mountain chains, and containing, in
the interior, many fertile valleys of considerable extent, which
are inhabited.&nbsp; Very little has been known of this great
interior region until the present century.</p>
<p>The ancient geographers divided Arabia into three
parts,&mdash;<i>Arabia Petr&aelig;a</i>, or the Rocky, comprising
the northwestern portion, including the Sinaitic peninsula,
between the Gulfs of Suez and Akaba; <i>Arabia Deserta</i>, the
great central desert; and <i>Arabia Felix</i>, the Happy, by
which they appear to have designated the southwestern part, now
known as Yemen.&nbsp; The modern Arabic geography, which has been
partly adopted on our maps, is based, to some extent, on the
political divisions of the country.&nbsp; The coast region along
the Red Sea, down to a point nearly half way between Djidda and
the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and including the holy cities of
Medina and Mecca, is called the Hedjaz.&nbsp; Yemen, the capital
of which is Sana, and the chief sea-ports Mocha, Hodeida, and
Loheia, embraces all the southwestern portion of the
peninsula.&nbsp; The southern coast, although divided into
various little chiefdoms, is known under the <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>general name of
Hadramaut.&nbsp; The kingdom of Oman has extended itself along
the eastern shore, nearly to the head of the Persian Gulf.&nbsp;
The northern oases, the seat of the powerful sect of the
Wahabees, are called Nedjed; and the unknown southern interior,
which is believed to be almost wholly desert, inhabited only by a
few wandering Bedouins, is known as the Dahna or Akhaf.</p>
<p>Arabia has been inhabited by the same race since the earliest
times, and has changed less, in the course of thousands of years,
than any other country of the globe, not excepting China.&nbsp;
According to Biblical genealogy, the natives are descended from
Ham, through Cush; but the Bedouins have always claimed that they
are the posterity of Ishmael.&nbsp; Some portions of the country,
such as Edom, or Idum&aelig;a, Teman and Sheba, (the modern
Yemen,) are mentioned in the Old Testament; but neither the
Babylonian, Assyrian, Persian, nor Egyptian monarchies succeeded
in gaining possession of the peninsula.&nbsp; Alexander the Great
made preparations for a journey of conquest, which was prevented
by his death, and Trajan was the only Roman emperor who
penetrated into the interior.</p>
<p>The inhabitants were idolaters, whose religion had probably
some resemblance to that of the Phoenicians.&nbsp; After the
destruction of Jerusalem, both Jews and Christians found their
way thither, and made proselytes.&nbsp; There were Jews in
Medina, Mecca, and Yemen; and even the last Himyaritic king of
the latter country became a convert to Mosaic faith.&nbsp; Thus
the strength of the ancient religion was <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>already
weakened when Mohammed was born (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 570); and there are strong evidences
for the conjecture that the demoralization of both Jews and
Christians, resulting from their long enmity, was the chief cause
which prevented Mohammed from adopting the belief of the
latter.&nbsp; At the time of his birth, the civilization of the
dominant Arab tribes was little inferior to that of Europe or the
Eastern Empire.&nbsp; There was already an Arabic literature; and
the arts and sciences of the ancient world had found their way
even to the oases of Nedjed.</p>
<p>The union of the best and strongest elements in the race,
which followed the establishment of the new religion, gave to men
of Arabian blood a part to play in the history of the
world.&nbsp; For six hundred years after Mohammed&rsquo;s death
Islam and Christendom were nearly equal powers, and it is
difficult, even now, to decide which contributed the more to the
arts from which modern civilization has sprung.&nbsp; Arabia
flourished, as never before, under the Caliphs; yet it does not
appear that the life of the inhabitants was materially changed,
or that any growth, acquired during the new importance of the
country, became permanent.&nbsp; Its commerce was restricted to
the products of its narrow belt of fertile shore; an arid desert
separated it from Bagdad and Syria; none of the lines of traffic
between Europe and the East Indies traversed its territory, and
thus it remained comparatively unknown to the Christian
world.</p>
<p>After the downfall of the Caliphate the tribes relapsed into
their former condition of independent <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>chiefdoms, and the old hostilities,
which had been partially suppressed for some centuries, again
revived.&nbsp; In the sixteenth century the Turks obtained
possession of Hedjaz and Yemen; the Portuguese held Muscat for a
hundred and fifty years, and the Persians made some temporary
conquests, but the vast interior region easily maintained its
independence.&nbsp; The deserts, which everywhere intervene
between its large and fertile valleys and the sea-coast, are the
home of wandering Bedouin tribes, whose only occupation is
plunder,&mdash;whose hand is against every man&rsquo;s, and every
man&rsquo;s hand against them.&nbsp; Thus they serve as a
body-guard even to their own enemies.</p>
<p>The long repose and seclusion of Central Arabia was first
broken during the present century.&nbsp; It may be well to state,
very briefly, the circumstances which led to it, since they will
explain the great difficulty and danger which all modern
explorers must encounter.&nbsp; Early in the last century, an
Arabian named Abd el-Wahab, scandalized at what he believed to be
the corruption of the Moslem faith, began preaching a
Reformation.&nbsp; He advocated the slaughter or forcible
conversion of heretics, the most rigid forms of fasting and
prayer, the disuse of tobacco, and various other changes in the
Oriental habits of life.&nbsp; Having succeeded in converting the
chief of Nedjed, Mohammed Ibu-Savod, he took up his residence in
Derreyeh, the capital, which thenceforth became the rendezvous
for all his followers, who were named <i>Wahabees</i>.&nbsp; They
increased to such an extent that their authority became supreme
<a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>throughout
Central Arabia, and the successor of Ibu-Savod was able to call
an army of 100,000 men into the field, and defy the Ottoman
power.</p>
<p>In the year 1803 the Wahabees took and plundered Mecca, and
slew great numbers of the pilgrims who had gathered there.&nbsp;
A second expedition against Medina failed, but the annual caravan
of pilgrims was robbed and dispersed.&nbsp; Finally, in 1809, the
Sultan transferred to Mohammed Ali, of Egypt, the duty of
suppressing this menacing religious and political
rebellion.&nbsp; The first campaign in Arabia was a failure; the
second, under Ibrahim Pasha, was successful.&nbsp; He overcame
the Wahabees in 1818, captured Derreyeh, and razed it to the
ground.&nbsp; In 1828 they began a second war against Turkey, but
were again defeated.&nbsp; Since then they have refrained from
any further aggressive movement, but their hostility and bigotry
are as active as ever.&nbsp; The Wahabee doctrine flatters the
clannish and exclusive spirit of the race, and will probably
prevent, for a long time, any easy communication between Arabia
and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>The greater part of our present knowledge of Arabia has been
obtained since the opening of this century.&nbsp; The chief
seaports and the route from Suez to Mt. Sinai were known during
the Middle Ages, but all else was little better than a
blank.&nbsp; Within the last fifty or sixty years the mountains
of Edom have been explored, the rock-hewn city of Petra
discovered, the holy cities of Medina and Mecca visited by

account of Nedjed and the other central regions of Arabia, by the
intrepid English traveller, Mr. Palgrave.</p>
<p>Thus, only the southern interior of the peninsula remains to
be visited.&nbsp; The name given to it by the Arabs, <i>Roba
el-Khaly</i>, &ldquo;the abode of emptiness,&rdquo; no doubt
describes its character.&nbsp; It is an immense, undulating,
sandy waste, dotted with scarce and small oases, which give water
and shelter to the Bedouins, but without any large tract of
habitable land, and consequently without cities, or other than
the rudest forms of political organization.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Early Explorers of
Arabia</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the habit of travel began to
revive in the Middle Ages, its character was either religious or
commercial, either in the form of pilgrimages to Rome, Palestine,
(whenever possible), and the shrines of popular saints, or of
journeys to the Levant, Persia and the Indies, with the object of
acquiring wealth by traffic, the profits of which increased in
the same proportion as its hazards.&nbsp; From the time of
Trajan&rsquo;s expedition to Arabia, (in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 117) down to the sixteenth century,
we have no report of the history or condition of the country
except such as can be drawn from the earlier Jewish and Christian
traditions and the later Mohammedan records.</p>
<p>The first account of a visit to Arabia which appears to be
worthy of credence, is that given by Ludovico Bartema, of
Rome.&nbsp; After visiting Egypt, he joined the caravan of
pilgrims at Damascus, in 1503, in the company of a Mameluke
captain, himself disguised as a Mameluke renegade.&nbsp; After
several attacks from the Bedouins of the desert, the caravan
reached Medina, which he describes as containing three hundred
houses.&nbsp; Bartema gives a very correct <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>description of
the tomb of the Prophet, and scoffs at the then prevalent belief
that the latter&rsquo;s coffin is suspended in the air, between
four lodestones.</p>
<p>He thus describes an adventure which befell his company the
same evening after their visit to the mosque.&nbsp; &ldquo;At
almost three of the night, ten or twelve of the elders of the
sect of Mohammed entered into our caravan, which remained not
past a stone&rsquo;s cast from the gate of the city.&nbsp; These
ran hither and thither, crying like madmen with these words:
&lsquo;Mohammed, the messenger and apostle of God, shall rise
again!&nbsp; O Prophet, O God, Mohammed shall rise again!&nbsp;
Have mercy on us, God!&rsquo;&nbsp; Our captain and we, all
raised with this cry, took weapon with all expedition, suspecting
that the Arabs were come to rob our caravan.&nbsp; We asked what
was the cause of that exclamation, and what they cried?&nbsp; For
they cried as do the Christians when suddenly any marvellous
thing chanceth.&nbsp; The elders answered: &lsquo;Saw you not the
lightning which shone out of the sepulchre of the Prophet
Mohammed?&rsquo;&nbsp; Our captain answered that he saw nothing,
and we also being demanded, answered in like manner.&nbsp; Then
said one of the old men: &lsquo;Are you slaves?&rsquo;&nbsp; This
to say bought men, meaning thereby, Mamelukes.&nbsp; Then said
our captain: &lsquo;We are indeed Mamelukes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then
again the old man said: &lsquo;You, my lords, cannot see heavenly
things, as being <i>neophiti</i>, that is, newly come to the
faith, and not yet confirmed in our religion.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
therefore to be understood that none other shining came out of
the sepulchre than a certain flame, which the priests caused to
come out <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>of the open place of the tower, whereby they would have
deceived us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving Medina, the caravan travelled for three days over a
&ldquo;broad plain,&rdquo; all covered with white sand, in manner
as small as flour.&nbsp; Then they passed a mountain, where they
heard &ldquo;a certain horrible noise and cry,&rdquo; and after
journeying for ten days longer, during which time they twice
fought with &ldquo;fifty thousand Arabians,&rdquo; they reached
Mecca, of which Bartema says: &ldquo;The city is very fair, and
well inhabited, and containeth in round form six thousand houses
as well builded as ours, and some that cost three or four
thousand pieces of gold: it hath no walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bartema describes the ceremonies performed by the pilgrims,
with tolerable correctness.&nbsp; His fellowship with the
Mamelukes seems to have been a complete protection up to the time
when the caravan was ready to set out on its return to Damascus,
and the members of the troop were ordered to accompany it, on
pain of death.&nbsp; Then he managed to escape by persuading a
Mohammedan that he understood the art of casting cannon, and
wished to reach India, in order to assist the native monarchs in
defending themselves against the Portuguese.&nbsp; Reaching Jedda
in safety, Bartema sailed for Persia, visiting Yemen on the way;
made his way to India, and after various adventures, returned to
Europe by way of the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>The second European who made his way to the holy cities was
Joseph Pitts, an Englishman, who was captured by an Algerine
pirate, as a sailor-boy <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>of sixteen, and forced by his master
to become a Mussulman.&nbsp; After some years, when he had
acquired the Arabic and Turkish languages, he accompanied his
master for a pilgrimage to Mecca, by way of Cairo, Suez and the
Red Sea.&nbsp; Here he received his freedom; but continued with
the pilgrims to Medina, and returned to Egypt by land, through
Arabia Petr&aelig;a.&nbsp; After fifteen years of exile, he
succeeded in escaping to Italy, and thence made his way back to
England.</p>
<p>Pitts gives a minute and generally correct account of the
ceremonies at Mecca.&nbsp; He was not, of course, learned in
Moslem theology, and his narrative, like that of all former
visitors to Mecca, has been superseded by the more intelligent
description of Burckhardt; yet it coincides with the latter in
all essential particulars.&nbsp; His description of the city and
surrounding scenery is worth quoting, from the quaint simplicity
of its style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, as to Mecca.&nbsp; It is a town situated in a
barren place, (about one day&rsquo;s journey from the Red Sea),
in a valley, or rather in the midst of many little hills.&nbsp;
It is a place of no force, wanting both walls and gates.&nbsp;
Its buildings are, as I said before, very ordinary, insomuch that
it would be a place of no tolerable entertainment, were it not
for the anniversary resort of so many thousand Hagges (Hadjis),
or pilgrims, on whose coming the whole dependence of the town (in
a manner) is; for many shops are scarcely open all the year
besides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people here, I observed, are a poor sort of people,
very thin, lean and swarthy.&nbsp; The town is <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>surrounded
for several miles with many thousands of little hills, which are
very near one to the other.&nbsp; I have been on the top of some
of them near Mecca, where I could see some miles about, yet was
not able to see the farthest of the hills.&nbsp; They are all
stony-rock and blackish, and pretty near of a bigness, appearing
at a distance like cocks of hay, but all pointing towards
Mecca.&nbsp; Some of them are half a mile in circumference, but
all near of one height.&nbsp; The people here have an odd and
foolish sort of tradition concerning them, viz., That when
Abraham went about building the Beat-Allah (Beit-Allah, or
&lsquo;House of God&rsquo;), God by his wonderful providence did
so order it, that every mountain in the world should contribute
something to the building thereof; and accordingly every one did
send its proportion, though there is a mountain near Algier which
is called Corradog, <i>i.e.</i>, Black Mountain, and the reason
of its blackness, they say, is because it did not send any part
of itself towards building the temple at Mecca.&nbsp; Between
these hills is good and plain travelling, though they stand one
to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is upon the top of one of them a cave, which they
term Hira, <i>i.e.</i>, Blessing, into which, they say, Mahomet
did usually retire for his solitary devotions, meditations and
fastings; and here they believe he had a great part of the
Alcoran brought him by the angel Gabriel.&nbsp; I have been in
this cave, and observed that it is not at all beautified, at
which I admired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half a mile out of Mecca is a very steep hill,
and there are stairs made to go to the top of it, <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>where is a
cupola, under which is a cloven rock; into this, they say,
Mahomet when very young, viz., about four years of age, was
carried by the angel Gabriel, who opened his breast and took out
his heart, from which he picked some black blood specks, which
was his original corruption; then put it into its place again,
and afterward closed up the part; and that during this operation
Mahomet felt no pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next account of the same pilgrimage is given by Giovanni
Tinati, an Italian, who deserted from the French service on the
coast of Dalmatia, and became an Albanian soldier.&nbsp; Making
his way to Egypt, after various adventures, he became at last a
corporal in Mohammed Ali&rsquo;s body-guard, and shared in
several campaigns against the Wahabees.&nbsp; He did not,
however, penetrate very far inland from the coast, and his visit
to Mecca was the result of his desertion from the Egyptian army
after a defeat.&nbsp; His narrative contains nothing which has
not been more fully and satisfactorily stated by later
travellers.</p>
<p>By this time, however, the era of careful scientific
exploration had already commenced, and the descriptions which
have since then been furnished to us are positive contributions
to our knowledge of Arabia.&nbsp; With the exception of the
journey of Carsten Niebuhr, which embraces only the Sinaitic
Peninsula and Yemen, the important explorations&mdash;all of
which are equally difficult and daring&mdash;have been made since
the commencement of this century.</p>
<h2><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Niebuhr&rsquo;s Travels in
Yemen</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1760 the Danish government
decided to send an expedition to Arabia and India, for the
purpose of geographical exploration.&nbsp; The command was given
to Carsten Niebuhr, a native of Hanover, and a civil
engineer.&nbsp; Four other gentlemen, an artist, a botanist, a
physician, and an astronomer, were associated with him in the
undertaking; yet, by a singular fatality, all died during the
journey, and Niebuhr returned alone, after an absence of nearly
seven years, to publish the first narrative of travel based on
scientific observation.</p>
<p>The party sailed from Copenhagen for Smyrna in January, 1761,
visited Constantinople, and then proceeded to Egypt, where they
remained nearly a year.&nbsp; After a journey to Sinai, they
finally succeeded in engaging passage on board a vessel carrying
pilgrims from Suez to Jedda, and sailed from the former port in
October, 1762.&nbsp; They took the precaution of adopting the
Oriental dress, and conformed, as far as possible, to the customs
of the Mussulman passengers; thus the voyage, although very
tedious and uncomfortable, was not accompanied with any other
danger than that from the coral reefs along the Arabian
shore.&nbsp; The vessel touched at Yambo, the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>port of
Medina, and finally reached Jedda, after a voyage of nineteen
days.</p>
<p>The travellers entered Jedda under strong apprehensions of
ill-treatment from the inhabitants, but were favorably
disappointed.&nbsp; The people, it seemed, were already
accustomed to the sight of Christian merchants in their town, and
took no particular notice of the strangers, who went freely to
the coffee-houses and markets, and felt themselves safe so long
as they did not attempt to pass through the gate leading to
Mecca.&nbsp; The Turkish Pasha of the city received them kindly,
and they were allowed to hire a house for their temporary
residence.</p>
<p>After waiting six weeks for the chance of a passage to Mocha,
they learned that an Arabian vessel was about to sail for
Hodeida, one of the ports of Yemen.&nbsp; The craft, when they
visited it, proved to be more like a hogshead than a ship; it was
only seven fathoms long, by three in breadth.&nbsp; It had no
deck; its planks were extremely thin, and seemed to be only
nailed together, but not pitched.&nbsp; The captain wore nothing
but a linen cloth upon his loins, and his sailors, nine in
number, were black slaves from Africa or Malabar.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, they engaged passage, taking the entire vessel for
themselves alone; but when they came to embark, it was filled
with the merchandise of others.&nbsp; The voyage proved to be
safe and pleasant, and in sixteen days they landed at Loheia, in
Yemen.</p>
<p>The governor of this place was a negro, who had formerly been
a slave.&nbsp; He received the travellers with the greatest
kindness, persuaded them to leave <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>the vessel, and gave them a
residence, promising camels for the further journey by
land.&nbsp; Although they were somewhat annoyed by the great
curiosity of the inhabitants, their residence was so agreeable,
and offered the naturalists so many facilities for making
collections, that they remained nearly four months.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We had one opportunity,&rdquo; says Niebuhr, &ldquo;of
learning their ideas of the benefits to be derived from
medicine.&nbsp; Mr. Cramer had given a scribe an emetic which
operated with extreme violence.&nbsp; The Arabs, being struck at
its wonderful effects, resolved all to take the same excellent
remedy, and the reputation of our friend&rsquo;s skill thus
became very high among them.&nbsp; The Emir of the port sent one
day for him; and, as he did not go immediately, the Emir soon
after sent a saddled horse to our gate.&nbsp; Mr. Cramer,
supposing that this horse was intended to bear him to the Emir,
was going to mount him, when he was told that this was the
patient he was to cure.&nbsp; We luckily found another physician
in our party; our Swedish servant had been with the hussars in
his native country, and had acquired some knowledge of the
diseases of horses.&nbsp; He offered to cure the Emir&rsquo;s
horse, and succeeded.&nbsp; The cure rendered him famous, and he
was afterward sent for to human patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having satisfied themselves by this time that there was no
danger in travelling in Yemen, they did not wait for the
departure of any large caravan, but, on February 20, 1763, set
out from Loheia, mounted on asses, and made their way across the
<i>Tehama</i>, or low country, toward the large town of <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Beit
el-Fakih, which stands near the base of the coffee-bearing
hills.&nbsp; They wore dresses somewhat similar to those of the
natives, a long shirt, reaching nearly to the feet, a girdle, and
a mantle over the shoulders.&nbsp; The country was barren, but
there were many villages, and at intervals of every few miles
they found coffee-houses, or, rather, huts, for the refreshment
of travellers.&nbsp; After having suffered no further
inconvenience than from the brackish water, which is drawn from
wells more than a hundred feet deep, they reached Beit el-Fakih
in five days.</p>
<p>Here they were kindly received by one of the native merchants,
who hired a stone house for them.&nbsp; The town is seated upon a
well-cultivated plain; it is comparatively modern, but populous,
and the travellers, now entirely accustomed to the Arabian mode
of life, felt themselves safe.&nbsp; The Emir took no particular
notice of them, a neglect with which they were fully satisfied,
since it left them free to range the country in all
directions.&nbsp; Niebuhr, therefore, determined to make the
place the temporary headquarters of the expedition, and to give
some time to excursions in that part of Yemen.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hired an ass,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;and its owner agreed to
follow me as my servant on foot.&nbsp; A turban, a great coat
wanting the sleeves, a shirt, linen drawers, and a pair of
slippers, were all the dress that I wore.&nbsp; It being the
fashion of the country to carry arms in travelling, I had a sabre
and two pistols hung by my girdle.&nbsp; A piece of old carpet
was my saddle, and served me likewise for a seat, a table, and
various other purposes.&nbsp; To cover me at night, I had the
linen cloak which the <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>Arabs wrap about their shoulders, to
shelter them from the sun and rain.&nbsp; A bucket of water, an
article of indispensable necessity to a traveller in these arid
regions, hung by my saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a trip to the seaport of Hodeida, Niebuhr visited the
old town of Zebid, built on the ruins of an older city, which is
said to have once been the capital of all the low country.&nbsp;
Zebid is situated in a large and fertile valley, traversed during
the rainy season by a considerable stream, by which a large tract
of country is irrigated.&nbsp; There are the remains of an
aqueduct built by the Turks, but the modern town does not cover
half the space of the ancient capital.&nbsp; Zebid, however, is
still distinguished for its academy, in which the youth of all
that part of Yemen study such sciences as are now cultivated by
the Mussulmans.</p>
<p>Niebuhr&rsquo;s next trip was to the plantations of the famous
Mocha coffee, whither the other members of the party had already
gone, during his visit to Zebid.&nbsp; After riding about twenty
miles eastward from Beit el-Fakih, he reached the foot of the
mountains.&nbsp; He thus describes the region: &ldquo;Neither
asses nor mules can be used here.&nbsp; The hills are to be
climbed by steep and narrow paths; yet, in comparison with the
parched plains of the Tehama, the scenery seemed to me charming,
as it was covered with gardens and plantations of
coffee-trees.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>&ldquo;Up to this time I had seen only one small
basaltic hill; but here whole mountains were composed chiefly of
those columns.&nbsp; Such detached rocks formed grand objects in
the landscape, especially where cascades of water were seen to
rush from their summits.&nbsp; The cascades, in such instances,
had the appearance of being supported by rows of artificial
pillars.&nbsp; These basalts are of great utility to the
inhabitants; the columns, which are easily separated, serve as
steps where the ascent is most difficult, and as materials for
walls to support the plantations of coffee-trees upon the steep
declivities of the mountains.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p19b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Coffee hills of Yemen"
title=
"Coffee hills of Yemen"
src="images/p19s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The tree which affords the coffee is well known in
Europe; so that I need not here describe it particularly.&nbsp;
The coffee-trees were all in flower at Bulgosa, and exhaled an
exquisitely agreeable perfume.&nbsp; They are planted upon
terraces, in the form of an amphitheatre.&nbsp; Most of them are
only watered by the rains that fall, but some, indeed, from large
reservoirs upon the heights, in which spring-water is collected,
in order to be sprinkled upon the terraces, where the trees grow
so thick together that the rays of the sun can hardly enter among
their branches.&nbsp; We were told that those trees, thus
artificially watered, yielded ripe fruit twice in the year; but
the fruit becomes not fully ripe the second time, and the coffee
of this crop is always inferior to that of the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stones being more common in this part of the country
than in the Tehama, the houses&mdash;as well of the villages as
those which are scattered solitarily over the hills&mdash;are
built of this material.&nbsp; Although not to be compared to the
houses of Europe for commodiousness and elegance, yet they have a
good appearance; especially such of them as stand upon the <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>heights, with
amphitheatres of beautiful gardens and trees around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even at this village of Bulgosa we were greatly above
the level of the plain from which we had ascended; yet we had
scarcely climbed half the ascent to Kusma, where the Emir of this
district dwells, upon the loftiest peak of the range of
mountains.&nbsp; Enchanting landscapes there meet the eye on all
sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We passed the night at Bulgosa.&nbsp; Several of the
men of the village came to see us, and after they retired we had
a visit from our hostess, with some young women accompanying her,
who were all very desirous to see the Europeans.&nbsp; They
seemed less shy than the women in the cities; their faces were
unveiled, and they talked freely with us.&nbsp; As the air is
fresher and cooler upon these hills, the women have a finer and
fairer complexion than in the plain.&nbsp; Our artist drew a
portrait of a young girl who was going to draw water, and was
dressed in a shirt of linen, checkered blue and white.&nbsp; The
top and middle of the shirt, as well as the lower part of the
drawers, were embroidered with needlework of different
colors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having met with no molestation so far, Niebuhr determined to
make a longer excursion into the southern interior of Yemen,
among the mountains, to the important towns of Udden and
Taas.&nbsp; The preparations were easily made.&nbsp; The
travellers hired asses, the owners accompanying them on foot as
guides and servants.&nbsp; As a further disguise they assumed
Arabic names, and their real character was so <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>well
concealed that even the guides supposed them to be Oriental
Christians&mdash;not Europeans.&nbsp; Entering the mountains by
an unfrequented road, they found a barren region at first, but
soon reached valleys where coffee was cultivated.&nbsp; The
inhabitants, on account of the cooler nights, sleep in linen
bags, which they draw over the head, and thus keep themselves
warm by their own breathing.</p>
<p>After reaching Udden, which Niebuhr found to be a town of only
three hundred houses, the hill-country became more thickly
settled.&nbsp; Beside the roads, which had formerly been paved
with stones, there were frequent tanks of water for the use of
travellers, and, in exposed places, houses for their shelter in
case of storms.&nbsp; The next important place was Djobla, a
place of some importance in the annals of Yemen, but with no
antiquities, except some ruined mosques.&nbsp; A further march of
two days brought the party to the fortified city of Taas, but
they did not venture within its walls, not having applied to the
Emir for permission.&nbsp; They returned to their quarters at
Beit el-Fakih, by way of Haas, another large town at the base of
the mountains, having made themselves acquainted with a large
portion of the hill-country of Arabia Felix.</p>
<p>The journey to Mocha lasted three days, over a hot, barren
plain, with no inhabitants except in the wadys or valleys, which
are well watered during the rainy season.&nbsp; Their arrival at
Mocha was followed by a series of annoyances, first from the
custom-house officials, and then from the Emir, who conceived a
sudden prejudice against the travellers, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>so that they
were in danger of being driven out of the city.&nbsp; An English
merchant, however, came to their assistance, a present of fifty
ducats mollified the Emir, and at the end of a very disagreeable
week they received permission to stay in the city.&nbsp; From
heat and privation they had all become ill, and in a short time
one of the party died.</p>
<p>Niebuhr now requested permission to proceed to Sana, the
capital of Yemen.&nbsp; This the Emir refused, until he could
send word to the Im&acirc;m; but, after a delay of a month, he
allowed the party to go as far as Taas, which they reached in
four days, and where they were well received.&nbsp; The
refreshing rains every evening purified the air, and all
gradually recovered their health, except the botanist, who died
before reaching Sana.</p>
<p>Taas stands at the foot of the fertile mountain of Sabber,
upon which, the Arabs say, grow all varieties of plants and trees
to be found in the world.&nbsp; Nevertheless they did not allow
the travellers to ascend or even approach it.&nbsp; The city is
surrounded with a wall, between sixteen and thirty feet high, and
flanked with towers.&nbsp; The patron saint of the place is a
former king, Ismael Melek, who is buried in a mosque bearing his
name.&nbsp; No person is allowed to visit the tomb since the
occurrence of a miracle, which Niebuhr thus relates: &ldquo;Two
beggars had asked charity of the Emir of Taas, but only one of
them had tasted of his bounty.&nbsp; Upon this the other went to
the tomb of Ismael Melek to implore his aid.&nbsp; The saint,
who, when alive, had been very charitable, stretched his hand out
of the tomb and <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>gave the beggar a letter containing an order on the Emir
to pay him a hundred crowns.&nbsp; Upon examining this order with
the greatest care it was found that Ismael Melek had written it
with his own hand and sealed it with his own seal.&nbsp; The
governor could not refuse payment; but to avoid all subsequent
trouble from such bills of exchange, he had a wall built,
inclosing the tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Emir of Taas so changed in his behavior toward the
travellers, after a few days, that he ordered them to return to
Mocha.&nbsp; Finding all their arguments and protests in vain,
they were about to comply, when a messenger arrived from Mocha,
bringing the permission of the Im&acirc;m of Yemen for them to
continue their journey to Sana.&nbsp; They set out on June 28th,
and, after crossing the mountain ranges of Mharras and Samara, by
well-paved and graded roads, reached, in a week, the town of
Jerim, near the ruins of the ancient Himyaritic city of Taphar,
which, however, they were unable to visit on account of the
illness of Mr. Forskal, the botanist of the expedition.&nbsp;
This gentleman died in a few days; and they were obliged to bury
him by night, with the greatest precaution.</p>
<p>From Jerim it is a day&rsquo;s journey to Damar, the capital
of a province.&nbsp; The city, which is seated in the midst of a
fertile plain, and is without walls, contains five thousand
well-built houses.&nbsp; It has a famous university, which is
usually attended by five hundred students.&nbsp; The travellers
were here very much annoyed by the curiosity of the people, who
threw stones at their windows in order to force them <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>to show
themselves.&nbsp; There is a mine of native sulphur near the
place, and a mountain where cornelians are found, which are
highly esteemed throughout the East.</p>
<p>Beyond Damar the country is hilly, but every village is
surrounded with gardens, orchards, and vineyards, which are
irrigated from large artificial reservoirs built at the foot of
the hills.&nbsp; On reaching Sana the travellers were not allowed
to enter the city, but conducted to an unfurnished house without
the walls, where they were ordered to wait two days in entire
seclusion, until they could be received by the Im&acirc;m.&nbsp;
During this time they were not allowed to be visited by
anyone.&nbsp; Niebuhr thus describes their interview, which took
place on the third day:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hall of audience was a spacious square chamber,
having an arched roof.&nbsp; In the middle was a large basin,
with some <i>jets d&rsquo;eau</i>, rising fourteen feet in
height.&nbsp; Behind the basin, and near the throne, were two
large benches, each a foot and a half high; upon the throne was a
space covered with silken stuff, on which, as well as on both
sides of it, lay large cushions.&nbsp; The Im&acirc;m sat between
the cushions, with his legs crossed in the Eastern fashion; his
gown was of a bright green color, and had large sleeves.&nbsp;
Upon each side of his breast was a rich filleting of gold lace,
and on his head he wore a great white turban.&nbsp; His sons sat
on his right hand, and his brothers on the left.&nbsp; Opposite
to them, on the highest of the two benches, sat the Vizier, and
our place was on the lower bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were first led up to the Im&acirc;m, and were <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>permitted to
kiss both the back and the palm of his hand, as well as the hem
of his robe.&nbsp; It is an extraordinary favor when the
Mohammedan princes permit any person to kiss the palm of the
hand.&nbsp; There was a solemn silence through the whole
hall.&nbsp; As each of us touched the Im&acirc;m&rsquo;s hand a
herald still proclaimed, &lsquo;God preserve the
Im&acirc;m!&rsquo; and all who were present repeated these words
after him.&nbsp; I was thinking at the time how I should pay my
compliments in Arabic, and was not a little disturbed by this
noisy ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not think it proper to mention the true reason
of our expedition through Arabia; but told the Im&acirc;m that,
wishing to travel by the shortest ways to the Danish colonies, in
the East Indies, we had heard so much of the plenty and security
which prevailed through his dominions, that we had resolved to
see them with our own eyes, so that we might describe them to our
countrymen.&nbsp; The Im&acirc;m told us we were welcome to his
dominions, and might stay as long as we pleased.&nbsp; After our
return home he sent to each of us a small purse containing
ninety-nine <i>komassis</i>, two and thirty of which make a
crown.&nbsp; This piece of civility might, perhaps, appear no
compliment to a traveller&rsquo;s delicacy.&nbsp; But, when it is
considered that a stranger, unacquainted with the value of the
money of the country, obliged to pay every day for his
provisions, is in danger of being imposed upon by the
money-changers, this care of providing us with small money will
appear to have been sufficiently obliging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The city of Sana,&rdquo; says Niebuhr, &ldquo;is
situated at <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>the foot of Mount Nikkum, on which are still to be seen
the ruins of a castle, which the Arabs suppose to have been built
by Shem.&nbsp; Near this mountain stands the citadel; a rivulet
rises upon the other side, and near it is the Bostan
el-Metwokkel, a spacious garden, which was laid out by the
Im&acirc;m of that name, and has been greatly embellished by the
reigning Im&acirc;m.&nbsp; The walls of the city, which are built
of bricks, exclude this garden, which is inclosed within a wall
of its own.&nbsp; The city, properly so called, is not very
extensive; one may walk around it in an hour.&nbsp; There are a
number of mosques, some of which have been built by Turkish
Pashas.&nbsp; In Sana are only twelve public baths, but many
noble palaces, three of the most splendid of which have been
built by the reigning Im&acirc;m.&nbsp; The materials of these
palaces are burnt bricks, and sometimes even hewn stones; but the
houses of the common people are of bricks which have been dried
in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The suburb of Bir el-Arsab is nearly adjoining the city
on the east side.&nbsp; The houses of this village are scattered
through the gardens, along the banks of a small river.&nbsp;
Fruits are very plenteous; there are more than twenty kinds of
grapes, which, as they do not all ripen at the same time,
continue to afford a delicious refreshment for several
months.&nbsp; The Arabs likewise preserve grapes by hanging them
up in their cellars, and eat them almost through the whole
year.&nbsp; Two leagues northward from Sana is a plain named
Rodda, which is overspread with gardens and watered by a number
of rivulets.&nbsp; This place bears a great resemblance to the
neighborhood of Damascus.&nbsp; But <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>Sana, which some ancient authors
compare to Damascus, stands on a rising ground, with nothing like
florid vegetation about it.&nbsp; After long rains, indeed, a
small rivulet runs through the city; but all the ground is dry
through the rest of the year.&nbsp; However, by aqueducts from
Mount Nikkum the town and castle of Sana are, at all times,
supplied with abundance of excellent fresh water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a stay of a week the travellers obtained an audience of
leave, fearing that a longer delay might subject them to
suspicions and embarrassments.&nbsp; Two days afterward the
Im&acirc;m sent each of them a complete suit of clothes, with a
letter to the Emir of Mocha, ordering him to pay them two hundred
crowns as a farewell present.&nbsp; He also furnished them with
camels for the journey.&nbsp; Instead of returning by the same
road they determined to descend from the hill-country to their
old headquarters at Beit el-Fakih, and thence cross the lowland
to Mocha.</p>
<p>For two days they travelled over high, rocky mountains, by the
worst roads they found in Yemen.&nbsp; The country was poor and
thinly inhabited, and the declivities only began to be clothed
with trees and terraced into coffee plantations as they
approached the plains.&nbsp; The poorer regions are not
considered entirely safe by the Arabs, as the people frequently
plunder defenceless travellers; but the party passed safely
through this region, and reached Beit el-Fakih after a
week&rsquo;s journey from Sana.</p>
<p>Niebuhr and his companions reached Mocha early in August, and
toward the end of that month sailed in an English vessel for
Bombay, after a stay of ten <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>months in Yemen.&nbsp; The artist of
the expedition and the Swedish servant died on the Indian Ocean,
and the physician in India, a few months afterward, leaving
Niebuhr the sole survivor of the six persons who left Copenhagen
three years before.&nbsp; After having sent home the journals and
collections of the expedition he continued his travels through
the Persian Gulf, Bagdad, Armenia, and Asia Minor, finally
reaching Denmark in 1767.&nbsp; The era of intelligent,
scientific exploration, which is now rapidly opening all parts of
the world to our knowledge, may be said to have been inaugurated
by his travels.</p>

29</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Burckhardt&rsquo;s Journey
to Mecca and Medina</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Burckhardt</span>, to whom we are indebted
for the first careful and complete description of the holy cities
of Arabia, was a native of Lausanne, in Switzerland.&nbsp; After
having been educated in Germany, he went to London with the
intention of entering the English military service, but was
persuaded by Sir Joseph Banks to apply to the African Association
for an appointment to explore the Sahara, and the then unknown
negro kingdoms of Central Africa.&nbsp; His offer was accepted,
and after some preparation he went to Aleppo, in Syria, where he
remained for a year or two, engaged in studying Arabic and
familiarizing himself with Oriental habits of life.</p>
<p>His first journeys in Syria and Palestine, which were only
meant as preparations for the African exploration, led to the
most important results.&nbsp; He was the first to visit the
country of Hauran&mdash;the Bashan of Scripture&mdash;lying
southeast of Damascus.&nbsp; After this he passed through Moab,
east of the Dead Sea, and under the pretence of making a
pilgrimage to the tomb of Aaron on Mount Hor, discovered the
rock-hewn palaces and temples of Petra, which had been for many
centuries lost to the world.</p>
<p><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Burckhardt reached Cairo in safety, and after vainly
waiting some months for an opportunity of joining a caravan to
Fezzan, determined to employ his time in making a visit to Upper
Egypt and Nubia.&nbsp; Travelling alone, with a single guide, he
succeeded in reaching the frontiers of Dongola, beyond which it
was then impossible to proceed.&nbsp; He therefore returned to
Assouan, and joined a small caravan, which crossed the Nubian
Desert to Ethiopia, by very nearly the same route which Bruce had
taken in returning from Abyssinia.&nbsp; He remained some time at
Shendy, the capital of Ethiopia, and then, after a journey of
three months across the country of Takka, which had never before
been visited by a European, reached the port of Suakin, on the
Red Sea.&nbsp; Here he embarked for Jedda, in Arabia, where he
arrived in July, 1814.</p>
<p>By this time his Moslem character had been so completely
acquired that he felt himself free from suspicion.&nbsp;
Accordingly he decided to remain and take part in the pilgrimage
to Mecca and Medina, which was to take place that year, in
November.&nbsp; His funds, however, were nearly exhausted, and
the Jedda merchants refused to honor an old letter of credit upon
Cairo, which he still carried with him.&nbsp; In this emergency
he wrote to the Armenian physician of Mohammed Ali, who was at
that time with the Pasha at the city of Tayf (or Tayef), about
seventy miles southeast of Mecca.&nbsp; Mohammed Ali happening to
hear of this application, immediately sent a messenger with two
dromedaries, to summon Burckhardt to visit him.&nbsp; It seems
most probable <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>that the Pasha suspected the traveller of being an
English spy, and wished to examine him personally.&nbsp; The
guide had orders to conduct the latter to Tayf by a circuitous
route, instead of by the direct road through Mecca.</p>
<p>Burckhardt set out without the least hesitation, taking care
to exhibit no suspicion of the Pasha&rsquo;s object, and no
desire to see the holy city.&nbsp; But the guide himself proposed
that they should pass through Mecca in order to save travel; the
journey was hurried, however, and only a rapid observation was
possible.&nbsp; Pushing eastward, they reached, on the third
night, the Mountain of Kora, which divides the territory of Mecca
from that of Tayf.&nbsp; Burckhardt was astonished at the change
in the scenery, produced by the greater elevation of the interior
of Arabia above the sea.&nbsp; His description is a striking
contrast to that of the scenery about Mecca.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is the most beautiful spot
in the Hedjaz, and more picturesque and delightful than anything
I had seen since my departure from Lebanon, in Syria.&nbsp; The
top of Djebel Kora is flat, but large masses of granite lie
scattered over it, the surface of which, like that of the granite
rocks near the second cataract of the Nile, is blackened by the
sun.&nbsp; Several small rivulets descend from this peak and
irrigate the plain, which is covered with verdant fields and
large shady trees beside the granite rocks.&nbsp; To those who
have only known the dreary and scorching sands of the lower
country of the Hedjaz, this scene is as surprising as the keen
air which blows here is refreshing.&nbsp; Many of the fruit-trees
of Europe are <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>found here: figs, apricots, peaches, apples, the
Egyptian sycamore, almonds, pomegranates; but particularly vines,
the produce of which is of the best quality.&nbsp; After having
passed through this delightful district for about half an hour,
just as the sun was rising, when every leaf and blade of grass
was covered with a balmy dew, and every tree and shrub diffused a
fragrance as delicious to the smell as was the landscape to the
eye, I halted near the largest of the rivulets, which, although
not more than two paces across, nourishes upon its banks a green
alpine turf, such as the mighty Nile, with all its luxuriance,
can never produce in Egypt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burckhardt had an interview with Mohammed Ali on the evening
of his arrival in Tayf.&nbsp; His suspicions were confirmed: the
Kadi (Judge) of Mecca and two well-informed teachers of the
Moslem faith were present, and although the Pasha professed to
accept Burckhard&rsquo;s protestations of his Moslem character,
it was very evident to the latter that he was cunningly tested by
the teachers.&nbsp; Nevertheless, when the interview was over,
they pronounced him to be not only a genuine Moslem, but one of
unusual learning and piety.&nbsp; The Pasha was forced to submit
to this decision, but he was evidently not entirely convinced,
for he gave orders that Burckhardt should be the guest of his
physician, in order that his speech and actions might be more
closely observed.&nbsp; Burckhardt took a thoroughly Oriental way
to release himself from this surveillance.&nbsp; He gave the
physician so much trouble that the latter was very glad, at the
end of ten days, to procure from the Pasha permission for <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>him to return
to Mecca, in order to get rid of him.&nbsp; Burckhardt thereupon
travelled to the holy city in company with the Kadi himself.</p>
<p>At the valley of Mohram, nearly a day&rsquo;s journey from
Mecca, Burckhardt changed his garb for the <i>ihram</i>, or
costume worn by the pilgrims during their devotional
services.&nbsp; It consists of two pieces of either linen,
cotton, or woollen cloth; one is wrapped around the loins, while
the other is thrown over the shoulder in such a manner as to
leave the right arm entirely bare.&nbsp; On reaching Mecca he
obeyed the Moslem injunction of first visiting the great mosque
and performing all the requisite ceremonies before transacting
any worldly business.&nbsp; When this had been accomplished he
made a trip to Jedda for the purpose of procuring supplies, which
were necessary for the later pilgrimage to Medina, and then
established himself comfortably in an unfrequented part of Mecca,
to await the arrival of the caravan of pilgrims from
Damascus.</p>
<p>Burckhardt describes the great mosque of Mecca, which is
called the <i>Beit Allah</i>, or &ldquo;House of God,&rdquo; as
&ldquo;a large quadrangular building, in the centre of which
stands the Kaaba, an oblong, massive structure eighteen paces in
length, fourteen in breadth, and from thirty-five to forty feet
in height.&nbsp; It is constructed of gray Mecca stone, in large
blocks of different sizes, joined together in a very rough
manner, and with bad cement.&nbsp; At the northeast corner of the
Kaaba, near the door, is the famous Black Stone, which forms part
of the sharp angle of the building at four or five feet above the
ground.&nbsp; It is an <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>irregular oval of about seven inches
in diameter, with an undulating surface, composed of about a
dozen smaller stones of different sizes and shapes, well joined
together with a small quantity of cement, and perfectly
smoothed.&nbsp; It is very difficult to determine accurately the
quality of this stone, which has been worn to its present surface
by the millions of touches and kisses it has received.&nbsp; It
appears to me like a lava, containing several small extraneous
particles.&nbsp; Its color is now a deep reddish brown,
approaching to black.&nbsp; It is surrounded on all sides by a
border, composed of a substance which I took to be a close cement
of pitch and gravel; this border serves to support its detached
pieces.&nbsp; Both the border and the stone itself are encircled
by a silver band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Toward the end of November the caravans from Syria and Egypt
arrived, and at the same time Mohammed Ali, so that the
<i>hadj</i>, or pilgrimage, assumed a character of unusual pomp
and parade.&nbsp; The Pasha&rsquo;s <i>ihram</i> consisted of two
of the finest Cashmere shawls; the horses and camels belonging to
himself and his large retinue, with those of the Pasha of
Damascus and other Moslem princes, were decorated with the most
brilliant trappings.&nbsp; On arriving, the pilgrims did not halt
in Mecca, but continued their march to the Sacred Mountain of
Arafat, to the eastward of the city.&nbsp; A camp, several miles
in extent, was formed upon the plain, at the foot of the
mountain, and here Burckhardt joined the immense crowd, in order
to take his share in the ceremonies of the following day.</p>
<p>In the morning he climbed to the top of Arafat, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>which is an
irregular, isolated mass of granite, rising only about two
hundred feet above the plain.&nbsp; Overlooking thus the entire
camp, he counted more than three thousand tents, and estimated
that at least twenty-five thousand camels and seventy thousand
human beings were there collected together.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
scene,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;was one of the most extraordinary
which the earth affords.&nbsp; Every pilgrim issued from his tent
to walk over the plain and take a view of the busy crowds
assembled there.&nbsp; Long streets of tents, fitted up as
bazaars, furnished them with all kinds of provisions.&nbsp; The
Syrian and Egyptian cavalry were exercised by their chiefs early
in the morning, while thousands of camels were seen feeding upon
the dry shrubs of the plain all around the camp.&nbsp; The Syrian
pilgrims were encamped upon the south and southwest sides of the
mountain; the Egyptians upon the southeast.&nbsp; Mohammed Ali,
and Soleyman, Pasha of Damascus, as well as several of their
followers, had very handsome tents; but the most magnificent of
all was that of the wife of Mohammed Ali, the mother of Toossoon
Pasha and Ibrahim Pasha, who had lately arrived from Cairo with a
truly royal equipage, five hundred camels being necessary to
transport her baggage from Jedda to Mecca.&nbsp; Her tent was in
fact an encampment, consisting of a dozen tents of different
sizes, inhabited by her women; the whole enclosed by a wall of
linen cloth, eight hundred paces in circuit, the single entrance
to which was guarded by eunuchs in splendid dresses.&nbsp; The
beautiful embroidery on the exterior of this linen palace, with
the various colors displayed in every part of it, <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>constituted
an object which reminded me of some descriptions in the Arabian
tales of the Thousand and One Nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burckhardt also gives an interesting description of the sermon
preached on Mount Arafat, the hearing of which is an
indispensable part of the pilgrimage: unless a person is at least
present during its delivery, he is not entitled to the name of
<i>hadji</i>, or pilgrim.&nbsp; The great encampment broke up at
three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and Mount Arafat was soon
covered from top to bottom.&nbsp; &ldquo;The two Pashas, with
their whole cavalry drawn up in two squadrons behind them, took
their posts in the rear of the deep line of camels of the
pilgrims, to which those of the people of Hedjaz were also
joined; and here they waited in solemn and respectful silence the
conclusion of the sermon.&nbsp; Farther removed from the preacher
was the Scherif of Mecca, with his small body of soldiers,
distinguished by several green standards carried before
him.&nbsp; The two <i>mahmals</i>, or holy camels, which carry on
their backs the high structure which serves as the banner of
their respective caravans, made way with difficulty through the
ranks of camels that encircled the southern and eastern sides of
the hill, opposite to the preacher, and took their station,
surrounded by their guards, directly under the platform in front
of him.&nbsp; The preacher, who is usually the Kadi of Mecca, was
mounted upon a finely caparisoned camel, which had been led up
the steps: it was traditionally said that Mohammed was always
seated when he addressed his followers, a practice in which he
was imitated by all the Caliphs who came to the <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>pilgrimage,
and who from this place addressed their subjects in person.&nbsp;
The Turkish gentleman of Constantinople, however, unused to
camel-riding, could not keep his seat so well as the hardy
Bedouin prophet, and the camel becoming unruly, he was soon
obliged to alight from it.&nbsp; He read his sermon from a book
in Arabic, which he held in his hands.&nbsp; At intervals of
every four or five minutes he paused and stretched forth his arms
to implore blessings from above, while the assembled multitudes
around and before him waved the skirts of their <i>ihrams</i>
over their heads and rent the air with shouts of <i>Lebeyk</i>,
<i>Allah</i>, <i>huma lebeyk</i>!&mdash;&lsquo;Here we are at Thy
bidding, oh God!&rsquo;&nbsp; During the waving of the
<i>ihrams</i> the sides of the mountain, thickly crowded as it
was by the people in their white garments, had the appearance of
a cataract of water; while the green umbrellas, with which
several thousand pilgrims sitting on their camels below were
provided, bore some resemblance to a verdant plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burckhardt performed all the remaining ceremonies required of
a pilgrim; but these have been more recently described and with
greater minuteness by Captain Burton.&nbsp; He remained in Mecca
for another month, unsuspected and unmolested, and completed his
observations of a place which the Arabs believed they had safely
sealed against all Christian travellers.</p>
<p>Leaving Mecca with a small caravan of pilgrims, on January 15,
1815, he reached Medina after a journey of thirteen days, during
which he narrowly escaped being slain by the Bedouins.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>Burckhardt was attacked with fever soon after his
arrival at Medina, and remained there three months.&nbsp; The
ceremonies prescribed for the pilgrims who visit the city are
brief and unimportant; but the description of the tomb of
Mohammed is of sufficient interest to quote.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
mausoleum,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;stands at the southeastern
corner of the principal mosque, and is protected from the too
near approach of visitors by an iron railing, painted green,
about two-thirds the height of the pillars of the colonnade which
runs around the interior of the mosque.&nbsp; The railing is of
good workmanship, in imitation of filigree, and is interwoven
with open-worked inscriptions of yellow bronze, supposed by the
vulgar to be of gold, and of so close a texture that no view can
be obtained of the interior except by several small windows,
about six inches square, which are placed in the four sides of
the railing, about five feet above the ground.&nbsp; On the south
side, where are the two principal windows, before which the
devout stand when praying, the railing is plated with silver, and
the common inscription&mdash;&lsquo;There is no god but God, the
Evident Truth!&rsquo;&mdash;is wrought in silver letters around
the windows.&nbsp; The tomb itself, as well as those of Abu Bekr
and Omar, which stand close to it, is concealed from the public
gaze by a curtain of rich silk brocade of various colors,
interwoven with silver flowers and arabesques, with inscriptions
in characters of gold running across the midst of it, like that
of the covering of the Kaaba.&nbsp; Behind this curtain, which,
according to the historian of the city, was formerly changed
every six years, and is now renewed by the Porte <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>whenever the
old one is decayed, or when a new Sultan ascends the throne, none
but the chief eunuchs, the attendants of the mosque, are
permitted to enter.&nbsp; This holy sanctuary once served, as the
temple of Delphi did among the Greeks, as the public treasury of
the nation.&nbsp; Here the money, jewels, and other precious
articles of the people of Hedjaz were kept in chests, or
suspended on silken ropes.&nbsp; Among these was a copy of the
Koran in Cufic characters; a brilliant star set in diamonds and
pearls, which was suspended directly over the Prophet&rsquo;s
tomb; with all sorts of vessels filled with jewels, earrings,
bracelets, necklaces, and other ornaments sent as presents from
all parts of the empire.&nbsp; Most of these articles were
carried away by the Wahabees when they sacked and plundered the
sacred cities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Burckhardt reached Yambo (the port of Medina), at the end of
April, and, after running great danger from the plague, succeeded
in obtaining passage to the Peninsula of Sinai, whence he slowly
made his way back to Cairo.&nbsp; Here he waited for two years,
vainly hoping for the departure of a caravan for Central Africa,
and meanwhile assisting Belzoni in his explorations at
Thebes.&nbsp; In October, 1817, he died, and the people who knew
him only as Shekh Abdallah, laid his body in the Moslem
burying-ground, on the eastern side of Cairo.</p>
<h2><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Wellsted&rsquo;s
Explorations in Oman</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> the most satisfactory
account of the interior of Oman&mdash;the southeastern portion of
Arabia&mdash;has been given by Lieutenant Wellsted.&nbsp; While
in the Indian Navy he was employed for several years in surveying
the southern and eastern coasts of Arabia.&nbsp; Having become
somewhat familiar with the language and habits of the people, he
conceived the idea of undertaking a journey to Derreyeh, in
Nedjed, the capital of the Wahabees, which no traveller had then
reached.&nbsp; The governor of Bombay gave him the necessary
leave of absence, and he landed at Muscat in November, 1835.</p>
<p>The Sultan, Sayid Saeed, received the young Englishman with
great kindness, promised him all possible aid in his undertaking,
and even arranged for him the route to be travelled.&nbsp; He was
to sail first to the port of Sur, south of Muscat, thence
penetrate to the country inhabited by the Beni-Abu-Ali tribe, and
make his way northward to the Jebel Akhdar, or Green Mountains,
which were described to him as lofty, fruitful, and
populous.&nbsp; Having thus visited the most interesting portions
of Oman, he was then to be at liberty, if the way was open, to
take the northern route through the Desert toward Nedjed.&nbsp;
<a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>The Sultan
presented him with a horse and sword, together with letters to
the governors of the districts through which he should pass.</p>
<p>At Sur, which is a small, insignificant village, with a good
harbor, the mountains of the interior approach the sea, but they
are here divided by a valley which furnishes easy access to the
country beyond them.&nbsp; After a journey of four days Wellsted
reached the tents of the tribe of Beni-Abu-Ali, at a point to
which the English troops had penetrated in 1821, to punish the
tribe for acts of piracy.&nbsp; Although no Englishman had
visited them since that time, they received him with every
demonstration of friendship.&nbsp; Sheep were killed, a feast
prepared, a guard of honor stationed around the tent, and, in the
evening, all the men of the encampment, 250 in number, assembled
for the purpose of exhibiting their war-dance.&nbsp; Wellsted
thus describes the scene: &ldquo;They formed a circle within
which five of their number entered.&nbsp; After walking leisurely
around for some time, each challenged one of the spectators by
striking him gently with the flat of his sword.&nbsp; His
adversary immediately leaped forth and a feigned combat
ensued.&nbsp; They have but two cuts, one directly downward, at
the head, the other horizontal, across the legs.&nbsp; They parry
neither with the sword nor shield, but avoid the blows by leaping
or bounding backward.&nbsp; The blade of their sword is three
feet in length, thin, double-edged, and as sharp as a
razor.&nbsp; As they carry it upright before them, by a peculiar
motion of the wrist they cause it to vibrate in a very remarkable
manner, which has a <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>singularly striking effect when they are assembled in
any considerable number.&nbsp; It was part of the entertainment
to fire off their matchlocks under the legs of some one of the
spectators who appeared too intent on watching the game to
observe their approach, and any signs of alarm which incautiously
escaped the individual added greatly to their mirth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the evening a party of the Geneba Bedouins came in from the
desert, accompanied by one of their chiefs.&nbsp; The latter
readily consented that Wellsted should accompany him on a short
journey into his country, and they set out the following
morning.&nbsp; It was December, and the morning air was cold and
pure; the party swept rapidly across the broad, barren plains,
the low hills, dotted with acacia trees, and the stony channels
which carried the floods of the rainy season to the sea.&nbsp;
After a day&rsquo;s journey of forty-four miles they encamped
near some brackish wells.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wished,&rdquo; said
the chief to Wellsted, &ldquo;to see the country of the Bedouins;
<i>this</i>,&rdquo; he continued, striking his spear into the
firm sand, &ldquo;<i>this</i> is the country of the
Bedouins.&rdquo;&nbsp; Neither he nor his companions wore any
clothing except a single cloth around the loins.&nbsp; Their
hair, which is permitted to grow until it reaches the waist, and
is usually well plastered with grease, is the only covering which
protects their heads from the sun.</p>
<p>The second day&rsquo;s journey brought Wellsted to a small
encampment, where the chief&rsquo;s wives were abiding.&nbsp;
They conversed with him, unveiled, gave him coffee, milk, and
dates, and treated him with all the hospitality which their
scanty means allowed.&nbsp; <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>The Beni Geneba tribe numbers about
three thousand five hundred fighting men; they are spread over a
large extent of Southern Arabia, and are divided into two
distinct classes&mdash;those who live by fishing, and those who
follow pastoral pursuits.&nbsp; A race of fishermen, however, is
found on all parts of the Arabian coast.&nbsp; In some districts
they are considered a separate and degraded people, with whom the
genuine Bedouins will neither eat, associate, nor intermarry; but
among the Beni Geneba this distinction does not exist.</p>
<p>Wellsted might have penetrated much farther to the westward
under the protection of this tribe, and was tempted to do so; but
it seemed more important to move northward, and get upon some one
of the caravan tracks leading into Central Arabia.&nbsp; He
therefore returned to the camp of the Beni-Abu-Ali, where the
friendly people would hardly suffer him to depart, promising to
build a house for him if he would remain a month with them.&nbsp;
For two days he travelled northward, over an undulating region of
sand, sometimes dotted with stunted acacias, and reached a
district called Bediah, consisting of seven villages, each seated
in its little oasis of date palms.&nbsp; One striking feature of
these towns is their low situation.&nbsp; They are erected in
artificial hollows, which have been excavated to the depth of six
or eight feet.&nbsp; Water is then conveyed to them in
subterranean channels from wells in the neighboring hills, and
the soil is so fertile that irrigation suffices to produce the
richest harvest of fruit and vegetables.&nbsp; A single step
carries the traveller from the glare and sand of <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>the desert
into a spot teeming with the most luxuriant vegetation, and
embowered by lofty trees, whose foliage keeps out the sun.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some idea,&rdquo; says Wellsted, &ldquo;may be formed of
the density of this shade by the effect it produces in lessening
the terrestrial radiation.&nbsp; A Fahrenheit thermometer which
within the house stood at 55&deg;, six inches from the ground
fell to 45&deg;.&nbsp; From this cause and the abundance of water
they are always saturated with damp, and even in the heat of the
day possess a clammy coldness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On approaching Ibrah, the next large town to the north, the
country became hilly, and the valleys between the abrupt
limestone ranges increased in fertility.&nbsp; Wellsted thus
describes the place: &ldquo;There are some handsome houses in
Ibrah; but the style of building is quite peculiar to this part
of Arabia.&nbsp; To avoid the damp and catch an occasional beam
of the sun above the trees, they are usually very lofty.&nbsp; A
parapet surrounding the upper part is turreted, and on some of
the largest houses guns are mounted.&nbsp; The windows and doors
have the Saracenic arch, and every part of the building is
profusely decorated with ornaments of stucco in bas-relief, some
in very good taste.&nbsp; The doors are also cased with brass,
and have rings and other massive ornaments of the same metal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ibrah is justly renowned for the beauty and fairness of
its females.&nbsp; Those we met on the streets evinced but little
shyness, and on my return to the tent I found it filled with
them.&nbsp; They were in high glee at all they saw; every box I
had was turned over for their inspection, and whenever I
attempted to remonstrate against their proceedings they stopped
<a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>my mouth
with their hands.&nbsp; With such damsels there was nothing left
but to laugh and look on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Travelling two days farther in the northward, Wellsted reached
the town of Semmed, where he found a fine stream of running
water.&nbsp; The Shekh&rsquo;s house was a large fort, the rooms
of which were spacious and lofty, but destitute of
furniture.&nbsp; Suspended on pegs protruding from the walls were
the saddles, cloths, and harness of the horses and camels.&nbsp;
The ceilings were painted in various devices, but the floors were
of mud, and only partially covered with mats.&nbsp; Lamps formed
of shells, a species of murex, were suspended by lines from the
ceiling.&nbsp; On returning to the tent, after this visit, the
traveller found, as usual, a great crowd collected there, but
kept in order by a boy about twelve years of age.&nbsp; He had
taken possession of the tent, as its guardian, and allowed none
to enter without his permission.&nbsp; He carried a sword longer
than himself, and also a stick, with which he occasionally laid
about him.&nbsp; It is a part of the Arab system of education to
cease treating boys as children at a very early age, and they
acquire, therefore, the gravity and demeanor of men.</p>
<p>Beyond this place Wellsted was accompanied by a guard of
seventy armed men, for the country was considered insecure.&nbsp;
For two days and a half he passed many small villages, separated
by desert tracts, and then reached the town of Minn&agrave;, near
the foot of the Green Mountains.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Minn&agrave;,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;differs from the
other towns in having its cultivation in the open fields.&nbsp;
As we crossed these, with <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>lofty almond, citron, and orange
trees yielding a delicious fragrance on either hand, exclamations
of astonishment and admiration burst from us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Is
this Arabia?&rsquo; we said; &lsquo;this the country we have
looked on heretofore as a desert?&rsquo;&nbsp; Verdant fields of
grain and sugar-cane stretching along for miles are before us;
streams of water, flowing in all directions, intersect our path;
and the happy and contented appearance of the peasants agreeably
helps to fill up the smiling picture.&nbsp; The atmosphere was
delightfully clear and pure; and, as we trotted joyously along,
giving or returning the salutations of peace or welcome, I could
almost fancy that we had at last reached that &lsquo;Araby the
Blessed&rsquo; which I had been accustomed to regard as existing
only in the fictions of our poets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Minn&agrave; is an old town, said to have been erected
at the period of Narhirvan&rsquo;s invasion; but it bears, in
common with the other towns, no indications of antiquity; its
houses are lofty, but do not differ from those of Ibrah or
Semmed.&nbsp; There are two square towers, about one hundred and
seventy feet in height, nearly in the centre of the town; at
their bases the breadth of the wall is not more than two feet,
and neither side exceeds in length eight yards.&nbsp; It is
therefore astonishing, considering the rudeness of the materials
(they have nothing but unhewn stones and a coarse but apparently
strong cement), that, with proportions so meagre, they should
have been able to carry them to their present elevation.&nbsp;
The guards, who are constantly on the lookout, ascend by means of
a rude ladder, formed by placing bars of wood <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>in a diagonal
direction in one of the side angles within the interior of the
building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The important town of Neswah, at the western base of the Jebel
Akdar, or Green Mountains, is a short day&rsquo;s journey from
Minn&agrave;.&nbsp; On arriving there Wellsted was received in a
friendly manner by the governor, and lodged, for the first time
since leaving Muscat, in a substantial house.&nbsp; He was
allowed to visit the fortress, which, in that region, is
considered impregnable.&nbsp; He was admitted by an iron door of
great strength, and, ascending through a vaulted passage, passed
through six others equally massive before reaching the
summit.&nbsp; The form of the fort is circular, its diameter
being nearly one hundred yards, and to the height of ninety feet
it has been filled up by a solid mass of earth and stones.&nbsp;
Seven or eight wells have been bored through this, from several
of which they obtain a plentiful supply of water, while those
which are dry serve as magazines for their shot and
ammunition.&nbsp; A wall forty feet high surrounds the summit,
making the whole height of the fortress one hundred and fifty
feet.&nbsp; It is a work of extraordinary labor, and from its
appearance probably of considerable antiquity; but no certain
intelligence could be obtained on this point.</p>
<p>On Christmas-day Wellsted left Neswah on an excursion to the
celebrated Green Mountains.&nbsp; The Shekh of Tanuf, the first
village where he encamped, endeavored in every possible way to
dissuade him from undertaking the journey; but his resolute
manner and a few gifts overcame the difficulty.&nbsp; Mounted on
strong asses, the party commenced ascending a <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>precipitous
ridge by a track so narrow that they seemed at times to be
suspended over precipices of unknown depth.&nbsp; On the second
day they reached the village of Seyk.&nbsp; &ldquo;By means of
steps,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we descended the steep side of a
narrow glen, about four hundred feet in depth, passing in our
progress several houses perched on crags or other acclivities,
their walls built up in some places so as to appear but a
continuation of the precipice.&nbsp; These small, snug,
compact-looking dwellings have been erected by the natives one
above the other, so that their appearance from the bottom of the
glen, hanging as it were in mid-air, affords to the spectator a
most novel and interesting picture.&nbsp; Here we found, amid a
great variety of fruits and trees, pomegranates, citrons,
almonds, nutmegs, and walnuts, with coffee-bushes and
vines.&nbsp; In the summer, these together must yield a delicious
fragrance; but it was now winter, and they were leafless.&nbsp;
Water flows in many places from the upper part of the hills, and
is received at the lower in small reservoirs, whence it is
distributed all over the face of the country.&nbsp; From the
narrowness of this glen, and the steepness of its sides, only the
lower part of it receives the warmth of the sun&rsquo;s rays for
a short period of the day; and even at the time of our arrival we
found it so chilly, that, after a short halt, we were very happy
to continue our journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They halted for the night at a village called Shirazi, in the
heart of the mountains, the highest peaks of which here reach a
height of 6,000 feet above the sea.&nbsp; The inhabitants belong
to a tribe called the Beni Ryam, who are considered infidels by
the people of <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Neswah because they cultivate the grape for the purpose
of making wine.&nbsp; The next day the Arabs who formed
Wellsted&rsquo;s escort left him, and he had considerable
difficulty in returning to Neswah by another road.&nbsp; From
this point he had intended starting for Central Arabia, but the
funds which he expected did not arrive from Muscat, the British
agent there having refused to make the necessary advances.&nbsp;
Wellsted thereupon applied directly to the Sultan, Sayd Saeed,
for a loan, and while waiting an answer, made an excursion into
the desert, fifty miles to the westward of Neswah.&nbsp; With a
view to familiarize himself with the manners and domestic life of
the Bedouins, he mixed with them during this trip, living and
sleeping in their huts and tents.&nbsp; On all occasions he was
treated with kindness, and often with a degree of hospitality
above rather than below the means of those who gave it.</p>
<p>Although the Sultan of Muscat was willing to furnish the
necessary supplies, and arrangements had been made which Wellsted
felt sure would have enabled him to penetrate into the interior,
he was prevented from going forward by a violent fever, from the
effects of which he remained insensible for five days.&nbsp;
Recovering sufficiently to travel, his only course was to return
at once to the sea-coast, and on January 22, 1836, he left Neswah
for the little port of Sib, where he arrived after a slow journey
of eight days.&nbsp; He relates the following incident, which
occurred at Semayel, the half-way station: &ldquo;Weary and faint
from the fatigue of the day&rsquo;s journey, in order to enjoy
the freshness of the evening breeze I had <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>my carpet
spread beneath a tree.&nbsp; An Arab passing by paused to gaze
upon me, and, touched by my condition and the melancholy which
was depicted on my countenance, he proffered the salutation of
peace, pointed to the crystal stream which sparkled at my feet,
and said: &lsquo;Look, friend, for running water maketh the heart
glad!&rsquo;&nbsp; With his hands folded over his breast, that
mute but most graceful of Eastern salutations, he bowed and
passed on.&nbsp; I was in a situation to estimate sympathy; and
so much of that feeling was exhibited in the manner of this son
of the desert, that I have never since recurred to the incident,
trifling as it is, without emotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rest of four weeks at Sib recruited the traveller&rsquo;s
strength, and he determined to make another effort to reach
Central Arabia.&nbsp; He therefore applied to the Sultan for an
escort to Bireimah, the first town of the Wahabees, beyond the
northern frontier of Oman.&nbsp; The Sultan sent a guide, but
objected to the undertaking, as word had just arrived that the
Wahabees were preparing to invade his territory.&nbsp; Wellsted,
however, was not willing to give up his design without at least
making the attempt.&nbsp; He followed the coast, north of Muscat,
as far as the port of Suweik, where he was most hospitably
received by the wife of the governor, Seyd Hilal, who was
absent.&nbsp; &ldquo;A huge meal, consisting of a great variety
of dishes, sufficient for thirty or forty people, was prepared in
his kitchen, and brought to us, on large copper dishes, twice a
day during the time we remained.&nbsp; On these occasions there
was a great profusion of blue and gilt chinaware, cut glass
dishes, and decanters containing sherbet instead of
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;The Shekh,&rdquo; Wellsted continues,
&ldquo;after his return, usually spent the evening with us.&nbsp;
On one occasion he was accompanied by a professional storyteller,
who appeared to be a great favorite with him.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Whenever I feel melancholy or out of order,&rsquo; said
he, &lsquo;I send for this man, who very soon restores me to my
wonted spirits.&rsquo;&nbsp; From the falsetto tone in which the
story was chanted, I could not follow the thread of the tale,
and, upon my mentioning this to him, the Shekh very kindly sent
me the manuscript, of which the reciter had availed
himself.&nbsp; With little variation I found it to be the
identical Sindbad the Sailor, so familiar to the readers of the
Arabian Nights.&nbsp; I little thought, when first I perused
these fascinating tales in my own language, that it would ever be
my lot to listen to the original in a spot so congenial and so
remote.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Leaving Suweik on March 4th, Wellsted was deserted by his
camel-men at the end of the first day&rsquo;s march, but
succeeded in engaging others at a neighboring village.&nbsp; The
road, which at first led between low hills, now entered a deep
mountain-gorge, inclosed by abrupt mountains of rock several
thousand feet in height.</p>
<p>For two days the party followed this winding defile, where the
precipices frequently towered from three to four thousand feet
over their heads.&nbsp; Then, having passed the main chain, the
country became more open, and they reached the village of Muskin,
in the territory of the Beni Kalban Arabs.&nbsp; Their <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>progress
beyond this point was slow and tedious, on account of the country
being divided into separate districts, which are partly
independent of each other.&nbsp; At the next town, Makiniyat, the
Shekh urged them to go no farther, on account of the great risk,
but finally consented to furnish an escort to Obri, the last town
to the northward which acknowledges the sway of Muscat.&nbsp;
This was distant two days&rsquo; journey&mdash;the first through
a broad valley between pyramidal hills, the second over sandy
plains, which indicated their approach to the Desert.</p>
<p>Obri is one of the largest and most populous towns in
Oman.&nbsp; The inhabitants devote themselves almost exclusively
to agriculture, and export large quantities of indigo, sugar, and
dates.&nbsp; On arriving Wellsted went immediately to the
residence of the Shekh, whom he found to be a very different
character from the officials whom he had hitherto
encountered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my producing the
Im&acirc;m&rsquo;s letters,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;he read them,
and took his leave without returning any answer.&nbsp; About an
hour afterward he sent a verbal message to request that I should
lose no time in quitting his town, as he begged to inform me,
what he supposed I could not have been aware of, that it was then
filled with nearly two thousand Wahabees.&nbsp; This was indeed
news to us; it was somewhat earlier than we anticipated falling
in with them, but we put a good face on the matter, and behaved
as coolly as we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning the Shekh returned, with a positive refusal
to allow them to proceed farther.&nbsp; Wellsted demanded a
written refusal, as evidence which <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>he could present to the Sultan, and
this the Shekh at once promised to give.&nbsp; His object was
evidently to force the traveller away from the place, and such
was the threatening appearance of things that the latter had no
wish to remain.&nbsp; The Wahabees crowded around the party in
great numbers, and seemed only waiting for some pretext to
commence an affray.&nbsp; &ldquo;When the Shekh came and
presented me with the letter for the Sultan,&rdquo; says
Wellsted, &ldquo;I knew it would be in vain to make any further
effort to shake his resolution, and therefore did not attempt
it.&nbsp; In the meantime news had spread far and wide that two
Englishmen, with a box of &lsquo;dollars,&rsquo; but in reality
containing only the few clothes that we carried with us, had
halted in the town.&nbsp; The Wahabees and other tribes had met
in deliberation, while the lower classes of the townsfolk were
creating noise and confusion.&nbsp; The Shekh either had not the
shadow of any influence, or was afraid to exercise it, and his
followers evidently wished to share in the plunder.&nbsp; It was
time to act.&nbsp; I called Ali on one side, told him to make
neither noise nor confusion, but to collect the camels without
delay.&nbsp; In the meantime we had packed up the tent, the crowd
increasing every minute; the camels were ready, and we mounted on
them.&nbsp; A leader, or some trifling incident, was now only
wanting to furnish them with a pretext for an onset.&nbsp; They
followed us with hisses and various other noises until we got
sufficiently clear to push briskly forward; and, beyond a few
stones being thrown, we reached the outskirts of the town without
further molestation.&nbsp; I had often <a name="page54"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 54</span>before heard of the inhospitable
character of the inhabitants of this place.&nbsp; The neighboring
Arabs observe that to enter Obri a man must either go armed to
the teeth, or as a beggar with a cloth, and that not of decent
quality, around his waist.&nbsp; Thus, for a second time, ended
my hopes of reaching Derreyeh from this quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wellsted was forced to return to Suweik, narrowly escaping a
Bedouin ambush on the way.&nbsp; As a last attempt he followed
the coast as far as Schinas, near the mouth of the Straits of
Ormuz, and thence despatched a messenger to the Wahabees at
Birsimah.&nbsp; This plan also failed, and he then returned to
India.&nbsp; He has given us, however, the only authentic account
of the scenery and inhabitants of the interior of Oman, and his
travels are thus an important contribution to our knowledge of
Arabia.</p>
<p>It is a sufficient commentary on the exclusive character of
Interior Arabia, and the difficulties that bar the way there to
free and thorough exploration, that, although Lieutenant
Wellsted&rsquo;s journey was in 1835, we still (1892) have to
turn to his very interesting narrative for almost all we know of
the interior of Oman.</p>
<h2><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Wellsted&rsquo;s Discovery
of an Ancient City in Hadramaut</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">While</span> employed in the survey of the
southern coast of Arabia in the spring of 1835, Lieutenant
Wellsted was occupied for a time near the cape called Ras
el-Ase&iuml;da, in Hadramaut, about one hundred miles east of
Aden.&nbsp; On this cape there is a watch-tower, with the
guardian of which, an officer named Hamed, he became acquainted;
and on learning from the Bedouins of the neighborhood that
extensive ruins, which they described as having been built by
infidels, and of great antiquity, were to be found at some
distance inland, he prevailed upon the officer to procure him
camels and guides.</p>
<p>One day, having landed with a midshipman in order to visit
some inscriptions at a few hours&rsquo; distance, the Bedouins
who brought the camels refused to go to the place, but expressed
their willingness to convey the two Europeans to the ruined
city.&nbsp; Hamed declined to accompany them, on the plea of
sickness, and they were unsupplied with provisions or presents
for the Shekhs of the villages on the way.&nbsp; Still the chance
was too tempting to be lost.&nbsp; Wellsted decided to trust
himself to the uncertain protection of the Bedouins, sent his
boat to the <a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>surveying vessel with a message that it should meet him
at a point farther to the westward at the end of three days, and
set out for the ruins late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Leaving the sea-shore at sunset, they struck northward into
the interior, and travelled until after midnight, passing several
villages of the Diyabi Bedouins, a very fierce and powerful
tribe, who are dreaded by all their neighbors.&nbsp; Scraping for
themselves beds in the sand, the travellers slept until daybreak
without being disturbed.&nbsp; The path soon after mounted a
ledge about four hundred feet in height, from the summit of which
they obtained an extensive but dreary view of the surrounding
country.&nbsp; Their route lay along a broad valley, skirted on
each side by a lofty range of mountains.&nbsp; By eight
o&rsquo;clock the sun became so oppressive that the Bedouins
halted under the shade of some stunted tamarisk trees.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Within these burning hollows,&rdquo; says Wellsted,
&ldquo;the sun&rsquo;s rays are concentrated and thrown off as
from a mirror; the herbs around were scorched to a cindery
blackness; not a cloud obscured the firmament, and the breeze
which moaned past us was of a glowing heat, like that escaping
from the mouth of a furnace.&nbsp; Our guides dug hollows in the
sand, and thrust their blistered feet within them.&nbsp; Although
we were not long in availing ourselves of the practical lesson
they had taught us, I began to be far from pleased with their
churlish demeanor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the day they travelled over sandy and stony ridges, and
late in the afternoon entered the Wady Meifah, where they found
wells of good water <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>and scanty vegetation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The country now
began to assume a far different aspect.&nbsp; Numerous hamlets,
interspersed amid extensive date groves, verdant fields of grain,
and herds of sleek cattle, showed themselves in every direction,
and we now fell in with parties of inhabitants for the first time
since leaving the sea-shore.&nbsp; Astonishment was depicted on
their countenances, but as we did not halt they had no
opportunity of gratifying their curiosity by gazing at us for any
length of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the Bedouins, however, in spite of Wellsted&rsquo;s
remonstrances, told the people that the travellers were in search
of buried treasure.&nbsp; When the latter attempted to encamp
near a village, the inhabitants requested them to remove; the
guides proved to be ignorant of the road in the night, and they
would have been suffered to wander about without shelter but for
the kindness of an old woman, who conducted them to her
house.&nbsp; This proved to be a kind of khan for travellers, and
was already so crowded that the travellers were obliged to sleep
in an open courtyard.</p>
<p>They were hardly prepared for the scene which daylight
disclosed to them.&nbsp; &ldquo;The dark verdure of fields of
millet, sorghum, tobacco, etc., extended as far as the eye could
reach.&nbsp; Mingled with these we had the soft acacia and the
stately but more sombre foliage of the date palm; while the
creaking of numerous wheels with which the grounds were
irrigated, and in the distance several rude ploughs drawn by
oxen, the ruddy and lively appearance of the people, who now
flocked toward us from all quarters, <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>and the delightful and refreshing
coolness of the morning air, combined to form a scene which he
who gazes on the barren aspect of the coast could never
anticipate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After three hours&rsquo; travel through this bright and
populous region, they came in sight of the ruins, which the
inhabitants call <i>Nakab el-Hadjar</i> (meaning &ldquo;The
Excavation from the Rock&rdquo;).&nbsp; According to
Wellsted&rsquo;s estimate, they are about fifty miles from the
coast.</p>
<p>The following is Wellsted&rsquo;s description of the place:
&ldquo;The hill upon which these ruins are situated stands out in
the centre of the valley, and divides a stream which passes,
during floods, on either side of it.&nbsp; It is nearly eight
hundred yards in length, and about three hundred and fifty yards
at its extreme breadth.&nbsp; About a third of the height from
its base a massive wall, averaging from thirty to forty feet in
height, is carried completely around the eminence, and flanked by
square towers, erected at equal distances.&nbsp; There are but
two entrances, north and south; a hollow, square tower, measuring
fourteen feet, stands on both sides of these.&nbsp; Their bases
extend to the plain below, and are carried out considerably
beyond the rest of the building.&nbsp; Between the towers, at an
elevation of twenty feet from the plain, there is an oblong
platform which projects about eighteen feet without and within
the walls.&nbsp; A flight of steps was apparently once attached
to either extremity of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within the entrance, at an elevation of ten feet from
the platform, we found inscriptions.&nbsp; They are <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>executed with
extreme care, in two horizontal lines, on the smooth face of the
stones, the letters being about eight inches long.&nbsp; Attempts
have been made, though without success, to obliterate them.&nbsp;
From the conspicuous situation which they occupy, there can be
but little doubt but that, when deciphered, they will be found to
contain the name of the founder of the building, as well as the
date and purport of its erection. <a name="citation59"></a><a
href="#footnote59" class="citation">[59]</a>&nbsp; The whole of
the walls and towers, and some of the edifices within, are built
of the same material&mdash;a compact grayish-colored marble, hewn
to the required shape with the utmost nicety.&nbsp; The
dimensions of the slabs at the base were from five to seven feet
in length, two to three in height, and three to four in
breadth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now visit the interior, where the most
conspicuous object is an oblong square building, the walls of
which face the cardinal points: its dimensions are twenty-seven
by seventeen yards.&nbsp; The walls are fronted with a kind of
freestone, each slab being cut of the same size, and the whole so
beautifully put together that I endeavored in vain to insert the
blade of a small penknife between them.&nbsp; The outer,
unpolished surface is covered with small chisel-marks, which the
Bedouins have mistaken for writing.&nbsp; From the extreme care
displayed in the construction of this building, I have no doubt
that it is a temple, and my disappointment at finding the <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>interior
filled up with the ruins of the fallen roof was very great.&nbsp;
Had it remained entire, we might have obtained some clew to guide
us in our researches respecting the form of religion professed by
the earlier Arabs.&nbsp; Above and beyond this building there are
several other edifices, with nothing peculiar in their form or
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In no portion of the ruins did we succeed in tracing
any remains of arches or columns, nor could we discover on their
surface any of those fragments of pottery, colored glass, or
metals, which are always found in old Egyptian towns, and which I
also saw in those we discovered on the northwest coast of
Arabia.&nbsp; Except the attempts to deface the inscriptions,
there is no other appearance of the buildings having suffered
from any ravages besides those of time; and owing to the dryness
of the climate, as well as the hardness of the material, every
stone, even to the marking of the chisel, remains as perfect as
the day it was hewn.&nbsp; We were anxious to ascertain if the
Arabs had preserved any tradition concerning the building, but
they refer them, like other Arabs, to their pagan
ancestors.&nbsp; &lsquo;Do you believe,&rsquo; said one of the
Bedouins to me upon my telling him that his ancestors were then
capable of greater works than themselves, &lsquo;that these
stones were raised by the unassisted hands of the Kafirs?&nbsp;
No! no!&nbsp; They had devils, legions of devils (God preserve us
from them!), to aid them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his return to the sea, which occupied a day and a half,
Wellsted was kindly treated by the natives, and suffered only
from the intense heat.&nbsp; The vessel <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>was
fortunately waiting at the appointed place.&nbsp; Since the
journey was made (in 1836) Baron von Wrede, a German traveller,
has succeeded in exploring a portion of Hadramaut, penetrating as
far as Wady Doan, a large and populous valley, more than a
hundred miles from the coast.&nbsp; But a thorough exploration of
both Yemen and Hadramaut is still wanting, and when made, it will
undoubtedly result in many important discoveries.</p>

62</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Burton&rsquo;s
Pilgrimage</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Captain Richard F. Burton</span>, the
discoverer of the great Lake Tanganyika, in Central Africa, first
became known to the world by his daring and entirely successful
visit to Medina and Mecca, in the year 1853, in the disguise of a
Moslem pilgrim.&nbsp; Although his journey was that of
Burckhardt, reversed, and he describes the same ceremonies, his
account supplies many deficiencies in the narrative of his
predecessor, and has the merit of a livelier and more graphic
style.</p>
<p>Burton&rsquo;s original design was to cross the Arabian
Peninsula from west to east, as Palgrave has since done, and the
Royal Geographical Society was disposed to accept his
services.&nbsp; But he failed to obtain a sufficient leave of
absence from the East India Company, which only granted him a
furlough of one year&mdash;a period quite insufficient for the
undertaking.&nbsp; He therefore determined to prove at least his
fitness for the task, by making the pilgrimage to the holy
cities.&nbsp; He was already familiar with the Arabic and Persian
languages, and had the advantage of an Eastern cast of
countenance.</p>
<p>Like Burckhardt, he assumed an Oriental character at the
start, and during the voyage from <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Southampton to Alexandria was
supposed to be a Persian prince.&nbsp; For two or three months he
laboriously applied himself in Egypt to the necessary religious
studies, joined a society of dervishes, under the name of Shekh
Abdullah, kept the severe fast of Ramazan, and familiarized
himself with all the orthodox forms of ablution, prayer, and
prostration.&nbsp; He gave himself out to be an Afghan by birth,
but long absent from his native country, a character which was
well adapted to secure him against detection.&nbsp; During his
stay in Cairo he made the acquaintance of a boy named Mohammed
el-Basyuni, a native of Mecca, who became his companion for the
journey, and who seems not to have suspected his real character
until the pilgrimage was over.</p>
<p>Having purchased a tent and laid in an ample supply of
provisions, with about four hundred dollars in money, he went to
Suez about July 1st, with the avowed purpose of proceeding to
Mecca by way of Jedda, yet with the secret intention of visiting
Medina on the way.&nbsp; Here he became acquainted with a company
of pilgrims, whose good-will he secured by small loans of money,
and joined them in taking passage in a large Arab boat bound for
Yembo.&nbsp; The vessel was called the Golden Wire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Immense was the confusion,&rdquo; says Burton, &ldquo;on
the eventful day of our departure.&nbsp; Suppose us standing on
the beach, on the morning of a fiery July day, carefully watching
our hurriedly-packed goods and chattels, surrounded by a mob of
idlers who are not too proud to pick up waifs and strays, while
pilgrims rush about apparently mad, and friends <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>are weeping,
acquaintances vociferating adieux, boatmen demanding fees,
shopmen claiming debts, women shrieking and talking with
inconceivable power, children crying&mdash;in short, for an hour
or so we were in the thick of a human storm.&nbsp; To confound
confusion, the boatmen have moored their skiff half a dozen yards
away from the shore, lest the porters should be unable to make
more than double their fare from the pilgrims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sailed on July 6th, and were five days in reaching the
mouth of the Gulf of Akaba.&nbsp; While crossing to the Arabian
shore, the pilgrims are accustomed to repeat the following
prayer, which is a good example of Moslem invocation: &ldquo;O
Allah, O Exalted, O Almighty, O All-pitiful, O All-powerful, thou
art my God, and sufficeth to me the knowledge of it!&nbsp;
Glorified be the Lord my Lord, and glorified be the faith my
faith!&nbsp; Thou givest victory to whom thou pleaseth, and thou
art the glorious, the merciful!&nbsp; We pray thee for safety in
our goings-forth and in our standings-still, in our words and our
designs, in our dangers of temptation and doubts, and the secret
designs of our hearts.&nbsp; Subject unto us this sea, even as
thou didst subject the deep to Moses, and as thou didst subject
the fire to Abraham, and as thou didst subject the iron to David,
and as thou didst subject the wind, and devils, and genii, and
mankind to Solomon, and as thou didst subject the moon and
El-Burak to Mohammed, upon whom be Allah&rsquo;s mercy and His
blessing!&nbsp; And subject unto us all the seas in earth and
heaven, in the visible and in thine invisible worlds, the sea of
<a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>this life,
and the sea of futurity.&nbsp; O thou who reignest over
everything, and unto whom all things return, Khyar!
Khyar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A further voyage of another week, uncomfortable and devoid of
incident, brought the vessel to Yembo.&nbsp; As the pilgrims were
desirous of pushing on to Medina, camels were hired on the day of
arrival, and, a week&rsquo;s provisions having been purchased,
the little caravan started the next afternoon.&nbsp; Burton, by
the advice of his companions, assumed the Arab dress, but
travelled in a litter, both because of an injury to his foot, and
because he could thus take notes on the way without being
observed.&nbsp; On account of the heat the caravan travelled
mostly by night; the country, thus dimly seen, was low and barren
for the first two days, but on the third day they reached a
wilder region, which Burton thus describes: &ldquo;We travelled
through a country fantastic in its desolation&mdash;a mass of
huge hills, barren plains, and desert vales.&nbsp; Even the
sturdy acacias here failed, and in some places the camel grass
could not find earth enough to take root in.&nbsp; The road wound
among mountains, rocks, and hills of granite, over broken ground,
flanked by huge blocks and bowlders, piled up as if man&rsquo;s
art had aided nature to disfigure herself.&nbsp; Vast clefts
seemed like scars on the hideous face of earth; here they widened
into dark caves, there they were choked up with glistening drift
sand.&nbsp; Not a bird or a beast was to be seen or heard; their
presence would have argued the vicinity of water, and though my
companions opined that Bedouins were lurking among the rocks, I
decided that these <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Bedouins were the creatures of their fears.&nbsp; Above,
a sky like polished blue steel, with a tremendous blaze of yellow
light, glared upon us, without the thinnest veil of mist or
cloud.&nbsp; The distant prospect, indeed, was more attractive
than the near view, because it borrowed a bright azure tinge from
the intervening atmosphere; but the jagged peaks and the
perpendicular streaks of shadow down the flanks of the
mountainous background showed that no change for the better was
yet in store for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the little towns of El-Hamra and Bir Abbas the caravan
rested a day, suffering much from the intense heat, and with
continual quarrels between the pilgrims and the Arabs to whom the
camels belonged.&nbsp; At the latter place they were threatened
with a detention of several days, but the difficulty was settled,
and they set out upon the most dangerous portion of the
road.&nbsp; &ldquo;We travelled that night,&rdquo; says Burton
&ldquo;up a dry river-course in an easterly direction, and at
early dawn found ourselves in an ill-famed gorge, called <i>Shuab
el-Hadj</i> (the &lsquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Pass&rsquo;).&nbsp; The
loudest talkers became silent as we neared it, and their
countenances showed apprehension written in legible
characters.&nbsp; Presently, from the high, precipitous cliff on
our left, thin blue curls of smoke&mdash;somehow or other they
caught every eye&mdash;rose in the air, and instantly afterward
rang the loud, sharp cracks of the hill-men&rsquo;s matchlocks,
echoed by the rocks on the right.&nbsp; My shugduf had been
broken by the camel&rsquo;s falling during the night, so I called
out to Mansur that we had better splice the frame-work with a bit
of rope; he looked up, saw me laughing, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>and with an
ejaculation of disgust disappeared.&nbsp; A number of Bedouins
were to be seen swarming like hornets over the crests of the
rocks, boys as well as men carrying huge weapons, and climbing
with the agility of cats.&nbsp; They took up comfortable places
in the cut-throat eminence, and began firing upon us with perfect
convenience to themselves.&nbsp; The height of the hills and the
glare of the rising sun prevented my seeing objects very
distinctly, but my companions pointed out to me places where the
rock had been scarped, and a kind of breastwork of rough
stones&mdash;the Sangah of Afghanistan, piled up as a defence,
and a rest for the long barrel of the matchlock.&nbsp; It was
useless to challenge the Bedouins to come down and fight us upon
the plain like men; and it was equally unprofitable for our
escort to fire upon a foe ensconced behind stones.&nbsp; We had,
therefore, nothing to do but to blaze away as much powder and to
veil ourselves in as much smoke as possible; the result of the
affair was that we lost twelve men, besides camels and other
beasts of burden.&nbsp; Though the bandits showed no symptoms of
bravery, and confined themselves to slaughtering the enemy from
their hill-top, my companions seemed to consider this
questionable affair a most gallant exploit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After two more days of severe travel, the pilgrims, at early
dawn, came in sight of the holy city of Medina.&nbsp; Burton thus
describes the approach, and the view from the western ridge:
&ldquo;Half an hour after leaving the Wady el-Akik, or
&lsquo;Blessed Valley,&rsquo; we came to a huge flight of steps,
roughly cut in a long, broad line of black, scoriaceous
basalt.&nbsp; This is <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>called the <i>Mudarraj</i>, or flight
of steps over the western ridge of the so-called El-Harratain; it
is holy ground, for the Prophet spoke well of it.&nbsp; Arrived
at the top, we passed through a lane of black scoria, with deep
banks on both sides, and, after a few minutes a full view of the
city suddenly opened on us.&nbsp; We halted our beasts as if by
word of command.&nbsp; All of us descended, in imitation of the
pious of old, and sat down, jaded and hungry as we were, to feast
our eyes with a view of the Holy City.&nbsp; The prayer was,
&lsquo;O Allah! this is the <i>Haram</i> (sanctuary) of the
Prophet; make it to us a protection from hell fire, and a refuge
from eternal punishment!&nbsp; O, open the gates of thy mercy,
and let us pass through them to the land of joy!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As we looked eastward, the sun arose out of the horizon
of low hills, blurred and dotted with small tufted trees, which
gained a giant stature from the morning mists, and the earth was
stained with gold and purple.&nbsp; Before us lay a spacious
plain, bounded in front by the undulating ground of Nedjed; on
the left was a grim barrier of rocks, the celebrated Mount Ohod,
with a clump of verdure and a white dome or two nestling at its
base.&nbsp; Rightward, broad streaks of lilac-colored mists were
thick with gathered dew, there pierced and thinned by the morning
rays, stretched over the date-groves and the gardens of Kuba,
which stood out in emerald green from the dull tawny surface of
the plain.&nbsp; Below, at the distance of about two miles, lay
El Medina; at first sight it appeared a large place, but a closer
inspection proved the impression to be an erroneous
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>On
arriving at Medina, Burton became the guest of one of the company
he had met at Suez, and during his stay of a month in the city
performed all the religious ceremonies and visitations which are
prescribed for the pilgrim.&nbsp; He gives the following
description of the Prophet&rsquo;s mosque: &ldquo;Passing through
muddy streets&mdash;they had been freshly watered before evening
time&mdash;I came suddenly upon the mosque.&nbsp; Like that at
Mecca, the approach is choked up by ignoble buildings, some
actually touching the holy &lsquo;enceinte,&rsquo; others
separated by a lane compared with which the road around St.
Paul&rsquo;s is a Vatican square.&nbsp; There is no outer front,
no general aspect of the Prophet&rsquo;s mosque; consequently, as
a building it has neither beauty nor dignity.&nbsp; And entering
the Bab el-Rahmah&mdash;the Gate of Pity&mdash;by a diminutive
flight of steps, I was astonished at the mean and tawdry
appearance of a place so universally venerated in the Moslem
world.&nbsp; It is not like the Meccan mosque, grand and
simple&mdash;the expression of a single sublime idea; the longer
I looked at it the more it suggested the resemblance of a museum
of second-rate art, a curiosity-shop, full of ornaments that are
not accessories, and decorated with pauper splendor.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>We must also quote the traveller&rsquo;s account of his manner
of spending the day during his residence in Medina: &ldquo;At
dawn we arose, washed, prayed, and broke our fast upon a crust of
stale bread, before smoking a pipe, and drinking a cup of
coffee.&nbsp; Then it was time to dress, to mount, and to visit
the Haram in one of the holy places outside the city.&nbsp;
Returning before the sun became intolerable, we sat <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>together, and
with conversation, shishas and chibouques, coffee and cold water
perfumed with mastich-smoke, we whiled away the time till our
<i>ariston</i>, an early dinner which appeared at the primitive
hour of 11 <span class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&nbsp; The meal was
served in the <i>majlis</i> on a large copper tray sent from the
upper apartments.&nbsp; Ejaculating
&lsquo;Bismillah&rsquo;&mdash;the Moslem grace&mdash;we all sat
round it, and dipped equal hands in the dishes set before
us.&nbsp; We had usually unleavened bread, different kinds of
meat and vegetable stews, and at the end of the first course
plain boiled rice, eaten with spoons; then came the fruits, fresh
dates, grapes, and pomegranates.&nbsp; After dinner I used
invariably to find some excuse&mdash;such as the habit of a
&lsquo;Kayl&uacute;lah&rsquo; (midday siesta), or the being a
&lsquo;Saudawi,&rsquo; or person of melancholy temperament, to
have a rug spread in the dark passage, and there to lie reading,
dozing, smoking, or writing, all through the worst part of the
day, from noon to sunset.&nbsp; Then came the hour for receiving
and paying visits.&nbsp; The evening prayers ensued, either at
home or in the Haram, followed by our supper, another substantial
meal like the dinner, but more plentiful, of bread, meat,
vegetables, rice, and fruits.&nbsp; In the evening we sometimes
dressed in common clothes and went to the caf&eacute;; sometimes
on festive occasions we indulged in a late supper of sweetmeats,
pomegranates, and dried fruits.&nbsp; Usually we sat upon
mattresses spread upon the ground in the open air, at the
Shekh&rsquo;s door, receiving evening visits, chatting, telling
stories, and making merry, till each, as he felt the approach of
the drowsy god, sank down into his proper place, and fell
asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Burton
was charmed with the garden and date-groves about Medina, and
enjoyed the excursions, which were enjoined upon him as a
pilgrim, to Jebel Ohod, the mosque of Kuba, and other places in
the vicinity of the city.&nbsp; On August 28th the caravan of
pilgrims from Damascus arrived, and, on account of danger from
the Bedouins, decided to leave on the fourth day afterward,
taking the Desert road to Mecca, the same travelled by the Caliph
Haroun El-Raschid and his wife Zobeida, instead of the longer
road nearer the coast, which Burckhardt had followed.&nbsp; When
this plan was announced, Burton and his companions had but
twenty-four hours to make the necessary preparations; but by hard
work they were ready.&nbsp; Leaving Medina, they hastened onward
to secure good places in the caravan, which was composed of about
seven thousand pilgrims, and extended over many miles of the
road.</p>
<p>For the first four days they travelled southward over a wild,
desolate country, almost destitute of water and vegetation.&nbsp;
On account of heat, as well as for greater security, the journey
was made chiefly by night, although the forced marches between
the wells obliged them sometimes to endure the greatest heat of
the day.&nbsp; Burton says: &ldquo;I can scarcely find words to
express the weary horrors of a long night&rsquo;s march, during
which the hapless traveller, fuming, if a European, with
disappointment in his hopes of &lsquo;seeing the country,&rsquo;
is compelled to sit upon the back of a creeping camel.&nbsp; The
day sleep, too, is a kind of lethargy, and it is all but
impossible to preserve an appetite during the hours of
heat.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>After
making ninety-nine miles from Medina, they reached the village of
El Suwayrkiyah, which is included within the Meccan
territory.&nbsp; The town, consisting of about one hundred
houses, is built at the base and on the sides of a basaltic mass
which rises abruptly from the hard clayey plain.&nbsp; The summit
is converted into a rude fortalice by a bulwark of uncut stone,
piled up so as to make a parapet.&nbsp; The lower part of the
town is protected by a mud wall, with the usual semicircular
towers.&nbsp; Inside there is a bazaar, well supplied with meat
(principally mutton) by the neighboring Bedouins, and wheat,
barley, and dates are grown near the town.&nbsp; There is little
to describe in the narrow streets and the mud houses, which are
essentially Arab.&nbsp; The fields around are divided into little
square plots by earthen ridges and stone walls; some of the palms
are fine grown trees, and the wells appeared numerous.&nbsp; The
water is near the surface and plentiful, but it has a brackish
taste, highly disagreeable after a few days&rsquo; use, and the
effects are the reverse of chalybeate.</p>
<p>Seventeen miles beyond El Suwayrkiyah is the small village of
Sufayuah, beyond which the country becomes again very wild and
barren.&nbsp; Burton thus describes the scenery the day after
leaving Sufayuah: &ldquo;This day&rsquo;s march was peculiarly
Arabia.&nbsp; It was a desert peopled only with echoes&mdash;a
place of death for what little there is to die in it&mdash;a
wilderness where, to use my companion&rsquo;s phrase, there is
nothing but He (Allah).&nbsp; Nature, scalped, flayed, discovered
her anatomy to the gazer&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; The horizon was a sea
of mirage; gigantic <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>sand-columns whirled over the plain; and on both sides
of our road were huge piles of bare rock standing detached upon
the surface of sand and clay.&nbsp; Here they appeared in oval
lumps, heaped up with a semblance of symmetry; there a single
bowlder stood, with its narrow foundation based upon a pedestal
of low, dome-shaped rock.&nbsp; All are of a pink coarse-grained
granite, which flakes off in large crusts under the influence of
the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After four more long marches the caravan reached a station
called El Zaribah, where the pilgrims halted a day to assume the
<i>ihram</i>, or costume which they wear on approaching
Mecca.&nbsp; They were now in the country of the Utaybah
Bedouins, the most fierce and hostile of all the tribes on the
road.&nbsp; Although only two marches, or fifty miles, from
Mecca, the pilgrims were by no means safe, as the night after
they left Zaribah testified.&nbsp; While threading a narrow pass
between high rocks, in the twilight, there was a sudden discharge
of musketry and some camels dropped dead.&nbsp; The Utaybah,
hidden behind the rocks crowning the pass, poured down an
irregular fire upon the pilgrims, who were panic-stricken and
fell into great disorder.&nbsp; The Wahabees, however, commenced
scaling the rocks, and very soon drove the robbers from their
ambush.&nbsp; The caravan then hurried forward in great disorder,
leaving the dead and severely wounded lying on the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the beginning of the skirmish,&rdquo; says Burton,
&ldquo;I had primed my pistols, and sat with them ready for
use.&nbsp; But soon seeing that there was nothing to be done,
and, wishing to make an <a name="page74"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 74</span>impression&mdash;nowhere does Bobadil
now &lsquo;go down&rsquo; but in the East&mdash;I called aloud
for my supper.&nbsp; Shekh Nur, exanimate with fear, could not
move.&nbsp; The boy Mohammed ejaculated only an &lsquo;Oh,
sir!&rsquo; and the people around exclaimed in disgust, &lsquo;By
Allah! he eats!&rsquo; Shekh Abdullah, the Meccan, being a man of
spirit, was amused by the spectacle.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are these
Afghan manners, Effendim?&rsquo; he inquired from the shugduf
behind me.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I replied aloud, &lsquo;in my
country we always dine before an attack of robbers, because that
gentry is in the habit of sending men to bed
supperless.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Shekh laughed aloud, but those
around him looked offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The morning after this adventure the pilgrims reached the Wady
Laymun, or Valley of Limes, a beautiful region of gardens and
orchards, only twenty-four miles from Mecca.&nbsp; Here they
halted four hours to rest and enjoy the fruits and fresh water;
then the line of march was resumed toward the Holy City.&nbsp; In
the afternoon the range of Jebel Kora, in the southeast, became
visible, and as evening approached all eyes were strained, but in
vain, for a sight of Mecca.&nbsp; Night came down, and the
pilgrims moved slowly onward in the darkness.&nbsp; An hour after
midnight Burton was roused by a general excitement in the
caravan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mecca!&nbsp; Mecca!&rdquo; cried some
voices; &ldquo;The Sanctuary, O the Sanctuary!&rdquo; exclaimed
others, and all burst into loud cries of
&ldquo;<i>Labeyk</i>!&rdquo; not unfrequently broken by
sobs.&nbsp; Looking out from his litter the traveller saw by the
light of the southern stars the dim outlines of a large
city.&nbsp; They were passing over the last rocky <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>ridge by an
artificial cut.&nbsp; The winding path was flanked on both sides
by high watch-towers; a short distance farther they entered the
northern suburb.</p>
<p>The Meccan boy Mohammed, who had been Burton&rsquo;s companion
during the pilgrimage, conducted the latter to his mother&rsquo;s
house, where he remained during his stay.&nbsp; A meal of
vermicelli and sugar was prepared on their arrival in the night,
and after an hour or two of sleep they rose at dawn, in order to
perform the ceremonies of arrival.&nbsp; After having bathed,
they walked in their pilgrim garb to the <i>Beit Allah</i>, or
&ldquo;House of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; says Burton, &ldquo;there at last it lay,
the bourne of my long and weary pilgrimage, realizing the plans
and hopes of many and many a year.&nbsp; The mirage medium of
fancy invested the huge catafalque and its gloomy pall with
peculiar charms.&nbsp; There were no giant fragments of hoar
antiquity as in Egypt, no remains of graceful and harmonious
beauty as in Greece and Italy, no barbaric gorgeousness as in the
buildings of India; yet the view was strange, unique, and how few
have looked upon the celebrated shrine!&nbsp; I may truly say,
that, of all the worshippers who clung weeping to the curtain, or
who pressed their beating hearts to the stone, none felt for the
moment a deeper emotion than did the Hadji from the far
north.&nbsp; It was as if the poetical legends of the Arab spoke
truth, and that the waving wings of angels, not the sweet breezes
of morning, were agitating and swelling the black covering of the
shrine.&nbsp; But, to confess humbling truth, theirs <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>was the high
feeling of religious enthusiasm, mine was the ecstasy of
gratified pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burton&rsquo;s description of the Beit Allah and the Kaaba is
more minute and careful than that of Burckhardt, but does not
differ from it in any important particular.&nbsp; Neither is it
necessary to quote his account of the ceremonies to be performed
by each individual pilgrim, with all their mechanical
prostrations and repetitions.&nbsp; His account of the visit to
the famous Black Stone, however, is both curious and amusing:
&ldquo;For a long time I stood looking in despair at the swarming
crowd of Bedouin and other pilgrims that besieged it.&nbsp; But
the boy Mohammed was equal to the occasion.&nbsp; During our
circuit he had displayed a fiery zeal against heresy and schism
by foully abusing every Persian in his path, and the inopportune
introduction of hard words into his prayers made the latter a
strange patchwork.&nbsp; He might, for instance, be repeating
&lsquo;and I take refuge with thee from ignominy in this
world,&rsquo; when, &lsquo;O thou rejected one, son of the
rejected!&rsquo; would be the interpolation addressed to some
long-bearded Khorassani, &lsquo;and in that to come&mdash;O hog
and brother of a hoggess!&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he continued till I
wondered that no one dared to turn and rend him.&nbsp; After
vainly addressing the pilgrims, of whom nothing could be seen but
a mosaic of occiputs and shoulder-blades, the boy Mohammed
collected about half a dozen stalwart Meccans, with whose
assistance, by sheer strength, we wedged our way into the thin
and light-legged crowd.&nbsp; The Bedouins turned round upon us
like wildcats, but they had no daggers.&nbsp; The <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>season being
autumn, they had not swelled themselves with milk for six months;
and they had become such living mummies that I could have managed
single-handed half a dozen of them.&nbsp; After thus reaching the
stone, despite popular indignation, testified by impatient
shouts, we monopolized the use of it for at least ten
minutes.&nbsp; Whilst kissing it and rubbing hands and forehead
upon it I narrowly observed it, and came away persuaded that it
is a big a&euml;rolite.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p77b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Camp at Mount Arafat"
title=
"Camp at Mount Arafat"
src="images/p77s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On September 12th the pilgrims set out for Mount Arafat.&nbsp;
Three miles from Mecca there is a large village called Muna,
noted for three standing miracles&mdash;the pebbles, there thrown
at the Devil, return by angelic agency to whence they came;
during the three days of drying meat rapacious birds and beasts
cannot prey there, and flies do not settle upon the articles of
food exposed in the bazaars.&nbsp; Beyond the place there is a
mosque called El Khayf, where, according to some traditions, Adam
is buried, his head being at one end of the long wall and his
feet at the other, while the dome is built over his navel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arafat,&rdquo; says Burton, &ldquo;is about a six
hours&rsquo; march, or twelve miles, on the Taif road, due east
of Mecca.&nbsp; We arrived there in a shorter time, but our weary
camels, during the last third of the way, frequently threw
themselves upon the ground.&nbsp; Human beings suffered
more.&nbsp; Between Muna and Arafat I saw no less than five men
fall down and die upon the highway; exhausted and moribund, they
had dragged themselves out to give up the ghost where it departs
to <a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>instant
beatitude.&nbsp; The spectacle showed how easy it is to die in
these latitudes; each man suddenly staggered, fell as if shot,
and, after a brief convulsion, lay still as marble.&nbsp; The
corpses were carefully taken up, and carelessly buried that same
evening, in a vacant space amongst the crowds encamped upon the
Arafat plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be more picturesque than the view the
mountain affords of the blue peaks behind, and the vast
encampment scattered over the barren yellow plain below.&nbsp; On
the north lay the regularly pitched camp of the guards that
defend the unarmed pilgrims.&nbsp; To the eastward was the
Scherif&rsquo;s encampment with the bright mahmals and the gilt
knobs of the grander pavilions; whilst, on the southern and
western sides, the tents of the vulgar crowded the ground,
disposed in dowars, or circles, for penning cattle.&nbsp; After
many calculations, I estimated the number to be not less than
fifty thousand, of all ages and both sexes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the sermon on Arafat, which Burton describes in the same
manner as Burckhardt, the former gives an account of the
subsequent ceremony of &ldquo;stoning the Great Devil&rdquo; near
the village of Muna: &ldquo;&lsquo;The Shaytan el-Kabir&rsquo; is
a dwarf buttress of rude masonry, about eight feet high by two
and a half broad, placed against a rough wall of stones, at the
Meccan entrance to Muna.&nbsp; As the ceremony of
&lsquo;Ramy,&rsquo; or Lapidation, must be performed on the first
day by all pilgrims between sunrise and sunset, and as the Fiend
was malicious enough to appear in a rugged pass, the crowd makes
the place dangerous.&nbsp; <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>On one side of the road, which is not
forty feet broad, stood a row of shops belonging principally to
barbers.&nbsp; On the other side is the rugged wall of the
pillar, with a <i>chevaux de frise</i> of Bedouins and naked
boys.&nbsp; The narrow space was crowded with pilgrims, all
struggling like drowning men to approach as near as possible to
the Devil; it would have been easy to run over the heads of the
mass.&nbsp; Amongst them were horsemen with rearing
chargers.&nbsp; Bedouins on wild camels, and grandees on mules
and asses, with outrunners, were breaking a way by assault and
battery.&nbsp; I had read Ali Bey&rsquo;s self-felicitations upon
escaping this place with &lsquo;only two wounds in the left
leg,&rsquo; and had duly provided myself with a hidden
dagger.&nbsp; The precaution was not useless.&nbsp; Scarcely had
my donkey entered the crowd than he was overthrown by a
dromedary, and I found myself under the stamping and roaring
beast&rsquo;s stomach.&nbsp; By a judicious use of the knife, I
avoided being trampled upon, and lost no time in escaping from a
place so ignobly dangerous.&nbsp; Finding an opening at last, we
approached within about five cubits of the place, and holding
each stone between the thumb and forefinger of the ring hand,
cast it at the pillar, exclaiming: &lsquo;In the name of Allah,
and Allah is Almighty, I do this in hatred of the Fiend and to
his shame.&rsquo;&nbsp; The seven stones being duly thrown, we
retired, and entering the barber&rsquo;s booth, took our places
upon one of the earthen benches around it.&nbsp; This was the
time to remove the <i>ihram</i> or pilgrim&rsquo;s garb, and to
return to the normal state of El Islam.&nbsp; The barber shaved
our heads, and, after trimming our beards <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and cutting
our nails, made us repeat these words: &lsquo;I purpose loosening
my <i>ihram</i>, according to the practice of the Prophet, whom
may Allah bless and preserve!&nbsp; O Allah, make unto me in
every hair a light, a purity, and a generous reward!&nbsp; In the
name of Allah, and Allah is Almighty!&rsquo;&nbsp; At the
conclusion of his labor the barber politely addressed to us a
&lsquo;Naiman&rsquo;&mdash;Pleasure to you!&nbsp; To which we as
ceremoniously replied, &lsquo;Allah give thee
pleasure!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will conclude these quotations from Burton&rsquo;s
narrative with his description of a sermon in the great mosque of
Mecca.&nbsp; &ldquo;After returning to the city from the
sacrifice of sheep in the valley of Muna, we bathed, and when
noon drew nigh we repaired to the Haram for the purpose of
hearing the sermon.&nbsp; Descending to the cloisters below the
Bab el-Ziyadah, I stood wonderstruck by the scene before
me.&nbsp; The vast quadrangle was crowded with worshippers
sitting in long rows, and everywhere facing the central black
tower; the showy colors of their dresses were not to be surpassed
by a garden of the most brilliant flowers, and such diversity of
detail would probably not be seen massed together in any other
building upon earth.&nbsp; The women, a dull and sombre-looking
group, sat apart in their peculiar place.&nbsp; The Pasha stood
on the roof of Zem Zem, surrounded by guards in Nizam
uniform.&nbsp; Where the principal ulema stationed themselves the
crowd was thicker; and in the more auspicious spots naught was to
be seen but a pavement of heads and shoulders.&nbsp; Nothing
seemed to move but a few dervishes, who, censer in hand, sidled
through the rows and received the unsolicited alms <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>of the
faithful.&nbsp; Apparently in the midst, and raised above the
crowd by the tall, pointed pulpit, whose gilt spire flamed in the
sun, sat the preacher, an old man with snowy beard.&nbsp; The
style of head-dress called &lsquo;<i>taylasan</i>&rsquo; covered
his turban, which was white as his robes, and a short staff
supported his left hand.&nbsp; Presently he arose, took the staff
in his right hand, pronounced a few inaudible words, and sat down
again on one of the lower steps, whilst a Muezzin, at the foot of
the pulpit, recited the call to sermon.&nbsp; Then the old man
stood up and began to preach.&nbsp; As the majestic figure began
to exert itself there was a deep silence.&nbsp; Presently a
general &lsquo;Amin&rsquo; was intoned by the crowd at the
conclusion of some long sentence.&nbsp; And at last, toward the
end of the sermon, every third or fourth word was followed by the
simultaneous rise and fall of thousands of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the religious ceremonies of many lands, but
never&mdash;nowhere&mdash;aught so solemn, so impressive as this
spectacle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding that it was impossible for him to undertake the
journey across Central Arabia, both for lack of time and the
menacing attitude of the Desert tribes, Burton left Mecca for
Jedda at the end of September.&nbsp; Starting in the afternoon,
the chance caravan of returning pilgrims reached, about midnight,
a mass of huts called El Hadda, which is the usual half-way
halting-place.&nbsp; It is maintained solely for the purpose of
supplying travellers with coffee and water.&nbsp; Here the
country slopes gradually toward the sea, the hills recede, and
every feature denotes departure <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>from the upland plateau of
Mecca.&nbsp; After reaching here, and at some solitary
coffee-houses farther on the way, the pilgrims reached Jedda
safely at eight in the morning.</p>
<p>From this place Burton took passage on a steamer for Suez, and
returned to Cairo, but without the Meccan boy, Mohammed, who
began to have a suspicion of his true character, after seeing him
in company with some English officers, and who left him before
embarking.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s Travels
in Central Arabia: From Palestine to the Djowf</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. William Gifford Palgrave</span>, son
of Sir Francis Palgrave, the historian, performed, in
1862&ndash;63, a journey in Arabia, which gives us the first
clear and full account of the interior of the country, including
the great Wahabee state of Nedjed, the early home of Arabian
poetry and also of the famous Arabian breed of horses.&nbsp; Mr.
Palgrave&rsquo;s qualifications for the undertaking were in some
respects superior to those of either Burckhardt or Burton.&nbsp;
To a high degree of general culture and a vigorous and
picturesque style as a writer, he added a knowledge of the Arabic
language and literature equal to that of any native scholar; he
spoke the language as well as his mother tongue; his features
were sufficiently Oriental to disarm suspicion, and years of
residence in the East had rendered him entirely familiar with the
habits of the people and even with all those minor forms of
etiquette which are so rarely acquired by a stranger.&nbsp; His
narrative, therefore, is as admirable and satisfactory in its
character as the fields he traversed were new and
fascinating.&nbsp; It throws, indeed, so much indirect light upon
the experiences of all his predecessors, and is so <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>much richer
in its illustrations of Arab life and character that no brief
summary of its contents can do justice to its importance.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Of the first stage of the journey, from Gaza on the
Mediterranean to the little town of Ma&rsquo;an, which lies on
the route of the caravans from Damascus to Mecca, a short
distance to the northeast of Petra, and thus nearly on the
boundary between the country of Moab and Edom, Palgrave gives us
no account.&nbsp; Yet, in spite of the comparatively brief
distance traversed, it must have been both laborious and
dangerous.&nbsp; His narrative commences as follows, at the
moment of his departure from Ma&rsquo;an:</p>
<p><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>&ldquo;Once for all let us attempt to acquire a fairly
correct and comprehensive knowledge of the Arabian
Peninsula.&nbsp; With its coasts we are already in great measure
acquainted; several of its maritime provinces have been, if not
thoroughly, at least sufficiently, explored; Yemen and Hedjaz,
Mecca and Medina, are no longer mysteries to us, nor are we
wholly without information on the districts of Hadramaut and
Oman.&nbsp; But of the interior of the vast region, of its plains
and mountains, its tribes and cities, of its governments and
institutions, of its inhabitants, their ways and customs, of
their social condition, how far advanced in civilization or sunk
in barbarism, what do we as yet really know, save from accounts
necessarily wanting in fulness and precision?&nbsp; It is time to
fill up this blank in the map of Asia, and this, at whatever
risks, we will now endeavor; either the land before us shall be
our tomb, or we will traverse it in its fullest breadth, and know
what it contains from shore to shore.&nbsp; <i>Vestigia nulla
retrorsum</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such were my thoughts, and such, more or less, I should
suppose, those of my companion, when we found ourselves at fall
of night without the eastern gate of Ma&rsquo;an, while the
Arabs, our guides and fellow-travellers, filled their water-skins
from a gushing source hard by the town walls, and adjusted the
saddles and the burdens of their camels, in preparation for the
long journey that lay before us and them.&nbsp; It was the
evening of June 16, 1862; the largest stars were already visible
in the deep blue depths of a cloudless sky, while the crescent
moon, high to the <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>west, shone as she shines in those heavens, and promised
us assistance for some hours of our night march.&nbsp; We were
soon mounted on our meagre long-necked beasts, &lsquo;as
if,&rsquo; according to the expression of an Arab poet, &lsquo;we
and our men were at mast-heads,&rsquo; and now we set our faces
to the east.&nbsp; Behind us lay, in a mass of dark outline, the
walls and castle of Ma&rsquo;an, its houses and gardens, and
farther back in the distance the high and barren range of the
Sheraa&rsquo; Mountains, merging into the coast chain of
Hejaz.&nbsp; Before and around us extended a wide and level
plain, blackened over with countless pebbles of basalt and flint,
except where the moonbeams gleamed white on little intervening
patches of clear sand, or on yellowish streaks of withered grass,
the scanty product of the winter rains, and dried now into
hay.&nbsp; Over all a deep silence, which even our Arab
companions seemed fearful of breaking; when they spoke it was in
a half whisper and in a few words, while the noiseless tread of
our camels sped stealthily but rapidly through the gloom without
disturbing its stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some precaution was not indeed wholly out of place, for
that stage of the journey on which we were now entering was
anything but safe.&nbsp; We were bound for the Djowf, the nearest
inhabited district of Central Arabia, its outlying station, in
fact.&nbsp; Now the intervening tract offered for the most part
the double danger of robbers and of thirst, of marauding bands
and of the summer season.&nbsp; The distance itself to be
traversed was near two hundred miles in a straight line, and
unavoidable circumstances were likely to render it much
longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>Palgrave&rsquo;s companion was a native Syrian, named
Barakat&mdash;a man on whom he could fully rely.&nbsp; Hardy,
young, and enterprising, he belonged to a locality whose
inhabitants are accustomed to danger.&nbsp; But the Bedouins who
furnished the camels, and acted as guides, were of another
class.&nbsp; They were three in number&mdash;Salim, their leader,
a member of a powerful family of the Howeytat tribe, but outlawed
for pillage and murder, and two men, Alee and Djordee, utter
barbarians in appearance no less than in character.&nbsp; Even
Salim advised the travellers to avoid all familiarities with the
latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Myself and my companion,&rdquo; says Palgrave,
&ldquo;were dressed like ordinary class travellers of inner
Syria, an equipment in which we had already made our way from
Gaza on the sea-coast to Ma&rsquo;an without much remark or
unseasonable questioning from those whom we fell in with, while
we traversed a country so often described already by Pococke,
Laborde, and downward, under the name of Arabia Petra, that it
would be superfluous for me to enter into any new account of it
in the present work.&nbsp; Our dress, then, consisted partly of a
long stout blouse of Egyptian hemp, under which, unlike our
Bedouin fellow-travellers, we indulged in the luxury of the loose
cotton drawers common in the East, while our colored
head-kerchiefs, though simple enough, were girt by &rsquo;akkals
or headbands of some pretension to elegance; the loose
red-leather boots of the country completed our toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in the large travelling-sacks at our camels&rsquo;
sides were contained suits of a more elegant <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>appearance,
carefully concealed from Bedouin gaze, but destined for
appearance when we should reach better inhabited and more
civilized districts.&nbsp; This reserve toilet numbered articles
like the following: colored overdresses, the Syrian combaz,
handkerchiefs whose silk stripes relieved the plebeian cotton,
and girdles of good material and tasteful coloring; such clothes
being absolutely requisite to maintain our assumed
character.&nbsp; Mine was that of a native travelling doctor, a
quack if you will; and accordingly a tolerable dress was
indispensable for the credit of my medical practice.&nbsp; My
comrade, who in a general way passed for my brother-in-law,
appeared sometimes as a retail merchant, such as not unfrequently
visit these countries, and sometimes as pupil or associate in my
assumed profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our pharmacopoeia consisted of a few but well selected
and efficacious drugs, inclosed in small tight-fitting tin boxes,
stowed away for the present in the ample recesses of our
travelling bags; about fifty of these little cases contained the
wherewithal to kill or cure half the sick men of Arabia.&nbsp;
Medicines of a liquid form had been as much as possible omitted,
not only from the difficulty of insuring them a safe transport
amid so rough a mode of journeying, but also on account of the
rapid evaporation unavoidable in this dry and burning
climate.&nbsp; In fact two or three small bottles whose contents
had seemed to me of absolute necessity, soon retained nothing
save their labels to indicate what they had held, in spite of
airtight stoppers and double coverings.&nbsp; I record this,
because the hint may be useful to anyone who should <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>be inclined
to embark in similar guise on the same adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other objects requisite in medical practice, two
or three European books for my own private use, and kept
carefully secret from Arab curiosity, with a couple of Esculapian
treatises in good Arabic, intended for professional ostentation,
completed this part of our fitting-out.&nbsp; But besides these,
an ample provision of cloth handkerchiefs, glass necklaces,
pipe-bowls, and the like, for sale in whatever localities might
not offer sufficient facility for the healing art, filled up our
saddle-bags wellnigh to bursting.&nbsp; Last, but not least, two
large sacks of coffee, the sheet-anchor and main hope of our
commerce, formed alone a sufficient load for a vigorous
camel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first days of travel were a monotony of heat and
desolation.&nbsp; The deceptive lakes of the mirage covered the
tawny plain, and every dark basaltic block, lying here and there
at random, was magnified into a mountain in the heated
atmosphere.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dreary land of death, in which even the
face of an enemy were almost a relief amid such utter
solitude.&nbsp; But for five whole days the little dried-up
lizard of the plain that looks as if he had never a drop of
moisture in his ugly body, and the jerboa, or field-rat of
Arabia, were the only living creatures to console our view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a march during which we might have almost
repented of our enterprise, had such a sentiment been any longer
possible or availing.&nbsp; Day after day found us urging our
camels to their utmost pace for fifteen or sixteen hours together
out of the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>twenty-four, under a wellnigh vertical sun, which the
Ethiopians of Herodotus might reasonably be excused for cursing,
with nothing either in the landscape around or in the companions
of our way to relieve for a moment the eye or the mind.&nbsp;
Then an insufficient halt for rest or sleep, at most of two or
three hours, soon interrupted by the oft-repeated admonition,
&lsquo;if we linger here we all die of thirst,&rsquo; sounding in
our ears; and then to remount our jaded beasts and push them on
through the dark night, amid the constant probability of attack
and plunder from roving marauders.&nbsp; For myself, I was, to
mend matters, under the depressing influence of a tertian fever
contracted at Ma&rsquo;an, and what between weariness and low
spirits, began to imagine seriously that no waters remained
before us except the waters of death for us and of oblivion for
our friends.&nbsp; The days wore by like a delirious dream, till
we were often almost unconscious of the ground we travelled over
and the journey on which we were engaged.&nbsp; One only herb
appeared at our feet to give some appearance of variety and life;
it was the bitter and poisonous colocynth of the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our order of road was this: Long before dawn we were on
our way, and paced it till the sun, having attained about
half-way between the horizon and the zenith, assigned the moment
of alighting for our morning meal.&nbsp; This our Bedouins always
took good care should be in some hollow or low ground, for
concealment&rsquo;s sake; in every other respect we had ample
liberty of choice, for one patch of black pebbles with a little
sand and withered grass between <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>was just like another; shade or
shelter, or anything like them, was wholly out of the question in
such &lsquo;nakedness of the land.&rsquo;&nbsp; We then alighted,
and my companion and myself would pile up the baggage into a sort
of wall, to afford a half-screen from the scorching sun-rays, and
here recline awhile.&nbsp; Next came the culinary preparations,
in perfect accordance with our provisions, which were simple
enough; namely, a bag of coarse flour mixed with salt and a few
dried dates; there was no third item on the bill of fare.&nbsp;
We now took a few handfuls of flour, and one of the Bedouins
kneaded it with his unwashed hands or dirty bit of leather,
pouring over it a little of the dingy water contained in the
skins, and then patted out this exquisite paste into a large
round cake, about an inch thick and five or six inches
across.&nbsp; Meanwhile another had lighted a fire of dry grass,
colocynth roots, and dried camels&rsquo; dung, till he had
prepared a bed of glowing embers; among these the cake was now
cast, and immediately covered up with hot ashes, and so left for
a few minutes, then taken out, turned, and covered again, till at
last, half-kneaded, half-raw, half-roasted, and burnt all round,
it was taken out to be broken up between the hungry band, and
eaten scalding hot, before it should cool into an indescribable
leathery substance, capable of defying the keenest
appetite.&nbsp; A draught of dingy water was its sole but
suitable accompaniment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meal ended, we had again without loss of time to
resume our way from mirage to mirage, till &lsquo;slowly flaming
over all, from heat to heat, the day <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>decreased,&rsquo; and about an hour
before sunset we would stagger off our camels as best we might,
to prepare an evening feast of precisely the same description as
that of the forenoon, or more often, for fear lest the smoke of
our fire should give notice to some distant rover, to content
ourselves with dry dates, and half an hour&rsquo;s rest on the
sand.&nbsp; At last our dates, like &AElig;sop&rsquo;s
bread-sack, or that of Beyhas, his Arab prototype, came to an
end; and then our supper was a soldier&rsquo;s one; what that is
my military friends will know; but, grit and pebbles excepted,
there was no bed in our case.&nbsp; After which, to remount, and
travel on by moon or starlight, till a little before midnight we
would lie down for just enough sleep to tantalize, not
refresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was now the 22d of June, and the fifth day since our
departure from the wells of Wokba.&nbsp; The water in the skins
had little more to offer to our thirst than muddy dregs, and as
yet no sign appeared of a fresh supply.&nbsp; At last about noon
we drew near some hillocks of loose gravel and sandstone a little
on our right; our Bedouins conversed together awhile, and then
turned their course and ours in that direction.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hold
fast on your camels, for they are going to be startled and jump
about,&rsquo; said Salim to us.&nbsp; Why the camels should be
startled I could not understand; when, on crossing the mounds
just mentioned, we suddenly came on five or six black tents, of
the very poorest description, pitched near some wells excavated
in the gravelly hollow below.&nbsp; The reason of Salim&rsquo;s
precautionary hint now became evident, for our silly beasts
started <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>at
first sight of the tents, as though they had never seen the like
before, and then scampered about, bounding friskily here and
there, till what between their jolting (for a camel&rsquo;s run
much resembles that of a cow) and our own laughing, we could
hardly keep on their backs.&nbsp; However, thirst soon prevailed
over timidity, and they left off their pranks to approach the
well&rsquo;s edge and sniff at the water below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inhabitants of the tents showed the ordinary curiosity,
but were not unfriendly, and the little caravan rested there for
the remainder of the day.&nbsp; A further journey of two days
over a region of sand-hills, with an occasional well, still
intervened before they could reach Wady Sirhan&mdash;a long
valley running directly to the populated region of the
Djowf.&nbsp; While passing over this intermediate region an
incident occurred which had wellnigh put a premature end to the
travels and the travellers together.&nbsp; &ldquo;My readers, no
less than myself,&rdquo; says Palgrave, &ldquo;must have heard or
read many a story of the simoom, or deadly wind of the desert,
but for me I had never yet met it in full force; and its modified
form, or <i>shelook</i>, to use the Arab phrase, that is, the
sirocco of the Syrian waste, though disagreeable enough, can
hardly ever be termed dangerous.&nbsp; Hence I had been almost
inclined to set down the tales told of the strange phenomena and
fatal effects of this &lsquo;poisoned gale&rsquo; in the same
category with the moving pillars of sand, recorded in many works
of higher historical pretensions than
&lsquo;Thalaba.&rsquo;&nbsp; At those perambulatory columns and
sand-smothered caravans the <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Bedouins, whenever I interrogated
them on the subject, laughed outright, and declared that beyond
an occasional dust-storm, similar to those which anyone who has
passed a summer in Scinde can hardly fail to have experienced,
nothing of the romantic kind just alluded to occurred in
Arabia.&nbsp; But when questioned about the simoom, they always
treated it as a much more serious matter, and such in real
earnest we now found it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about noon, the noon of a summer solstice in the
unclouded Arabian sky over a scorched desert, when abrupt and
burning gusts of wind began to blow by fits from the south, while
the oppressiveness of the air increased every moment, till my
companion and myself mutually asked each other what this could
mean, and what was to be its result.&nbsp; We turned to inquire
of Salim, but he had already wrapped up his face in his mantle,
and bowed down and crouching on the neck of his camel, replied
not a word.&nbsp; His comrades, the two Sherarat Bedouins, had
adopted a similar position, and were equally silent.&nbsp; At
last, after repeated interrogations, Salim, instead of replying
directly to our questioning, pointed to a small black tent,
providentially at no great distance in front, and said: Try to
reach <i>that</i>; if we can get there we are saved.&rsquo;&nbsp;
He added: &lsquo;Take care that your camels do not stop and lie
down;&rsquo; and then, giving his own several vigorous blows,
relapsed into muffled silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We looked anxiously toward the tent; it was yet a
hundred yards off, or more.&nbsp; Meanwhile the gusts grew hotter
and more violent, and it was only by <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>repeated efforts that we could urge
our beasts forward.&nbsp; The horizon rapidly darkened to a deep
violet line, and seemed to draw in like a curtain on every side,
while at the same time a stifling blast, as though from some
enormous oven opening right on our path, blew steadily under the
gloom; our camels, too, began, in spite of all we could do, to
turn round and round and bend their knees, preparing to lie
down.&nbsp; The simoom was fairly upon us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we had followed our Arabs&rsquo; example by
muffling our faces, and now with blows and kicks we forced the
staggering animals onward to the only asylum within reach.&nbsp;
So dark was the atmosphere, and so burning the heat, that it
seemed that hell had risen from the earth, or descended from
above.&nbsp; But we were yet in time, and at the moment when the
worst of the concentrated poison-blast was coming around, we were
already prostrate, one and all, within the tent, with our heads
well wrapped up, almost suffocated, indeed, but safe; while our
camels lay without like dead, their long necks stretched out on
the sand, awaiting the passing of the gale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On our first arrival the tent contained a solitary
Bedouin woman, whose husband was away with his camels in the Wady
Sirhan.&nbsp; When she saw five handsome men like us rush thus
suddenly into her dwelling without a word of leave or salutation,
she very properly set up a scream to the tune of the four crown
pleas&mdash;murder, arson, robbery, and I know not what
else.&nbsp; Salim hastened to reassure her by calling out
&lsquo;friends,&rsquo; and without more words threw himself flat
on the ground.&nbsp; All followed his example in silence.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;We remained thus for about ten minutes, during
which a still heat like that of red-hot iron slowly passing over
us was alone to be felt.&nbsp; Then the tent walls began again to
flap in the returning gusts, and announced that the worst of the
simoom had gone by.&nbsp; We got up, half dead with exhaustion,
and unmuffled our faces.&nbsp; My comrades appeared more like
corpses than living men, and so, I suppose, did I.&nbsp; However,
I could not forbear, in spite of warnings, to step out and look
at the camels; they were still lying flat as though they had been
shot.&nbsp; The air was yet darkish, but before long it
brightened up to its usual dazzling clearness.&nbsp; During the
whole time that the simoom lasted, the atmosphere was entirely
free from sand or dust, so that I hardly know how to account for
its singular obscurity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late in the evening we continued our way, and next day
early entered Wady Sirhan, where the character of our journey
underwent a considerable modification; for the northerly Arabian
desert, which we are now traversing, offers, in spite of all its
dreariness, some spots of comparatively better cast, where water
is less scanty and vegetation less niggard.&nbsp; These spots are
the favorite resorts of Bedouins, and serve, too, to direct the
ordinary routes of whatever travellers, trade-led or from other
motives, may venture on this wilderness.&nbsp; These oases, if
indeed they deserve the name, are formed by a slight depression
in the surrounding desert surface, and take at times the form of
a long valley, or of an oblong patch, where rock and pebble give
place to a light soil more or less intermixed with sand, and
concealing under <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>its surface a tolerable supply of moisture at no great
distance below ground.&nbsp; Here, in consequence, bushes and
herbs spring up, and grass, if not green all the year round, is
at least of somewhat longer duration than elsewhere; certain
fruit-bearing plants, of a nature to suffice for meagre Bedouin
existence, grow here spontaneously; in a word, man and beast find
not exactly comfortable accommodation, but the absolutely needful
supply.&nbsp; Such a spot is Wady Sirhan, literally, the
&lsquo;Valley of the Wolf.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered Wady Sirhan on June 21st.&nbsp; &ldquo;Passing
tent after tent, and leaving behind us many a tattered Bedouin
and grazing camel, Salim at last indicated to us a group of
habitations, two or three of which seemed of somewhat more ample
dimensions than the rest, and informed us that our supper that
night (for the afternoon was already on the decline) would be at
the cost of these dwellings.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ajaweed,&rsquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, &lsquo;generous fellow,&rsquo; he subjoined, to
encourage us by the prospect of a handsome reception.&nbsp; Of
course we could only defer to his better judgment, and in a few
minutes were alongside of the black goats&rsquo; hair coverings
where lodged our intended hosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chief or chieflet, for such he was, came out, and
interchanged a few words of masonic laconism with Salim.&nbsp;
The latter then came up to us where we remained halted in
expectation, led our camels to a little distance from the tents,
made them kneel down, helped us to disburden them, and while we
installed ourselves on a sandy slope opposite to the abodes of
the tribe, recommended us to keep a sharp lookout after our
baggage, since there might be <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>pickers and stealers among our hosts,
for all &lsquo;Ajaweed&rsquo; as they were.&nbsp; Disagreeable
news! for &lsquo;Ajaweed&rsquo; in an Arab mouth corresponds the
nearest possible to our English &lsquo;gentlemen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Now, if the gentlemen were thieves, what must the blackguards
be?&nbsp; We put a good face on it, and then seated ourselves in
dignified gravity on the sand awaiting the further results of our
guide&rsquo;s negotiations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some time we remained undisturbed, though not
unnoticed; a group of Arabs had collected round our companions at
the tent door, and were engaged in getting from them all possible
information, especially about us and our baggage, which last was
an object of much curiosity, not to say cupidity.&nbsp; Next came
our turn.&nbsp; The chief, his family (women excepted), his
intimate followers, and some twenty others, young and old, boys
and men, came up, and, after a brief salutation, Bedouinwise
seated themselves in a semicircle before us.&nbsp; Every man held
a short crooked stick for camel-driving in his hand, to
gesticulate with when speaking, or to play with in the intervals
of conversation, while the younger members of society, less
prompt in discourse, politely employed their leisure in staring
at us, or in picking up dried pellets of dirt from the sand and
tossing them about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you? what is your business?&rsquo; so
runs the ordinary and unprefaced opening of the discourse.&nbsp;
To which we answer, &lsquo;Physicians from Damascus, and our
business is whatsoever God may put in our way.&rsquo;&nbsp; The
next question will be about the baggage; someone pokes it with a
stick, to <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>draw attention to it, and says, &lsquo;What is this?
have you any little object to sell us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fight shy of selling; to open out our wares and
chattels in full air, on the sand, and amid a crowd whose
appearance and circumstances offer but a poor guarantee for the
exact observance of the eighth commandment, would be hardly
prudent or worth our while.&nbsp; After several fruitless trials
they desist from their request.&nbsp; Another, who is troubled by
some bodily infirmity, for which all the united faculties of
London and Paris might prescribe in vain&mdash;a withered hand,
for instance, or stone-blind of an eye&mdash;asks for medicine,
which no sooner applied shall, in his expectation, suddenly
restore him to perfect health and corporal integrity.&nbsp; But I
had been already forewarned that to doctor a Bedouin, even under
the most favorable circumstances, or a camel, is pretty much the
same thing, and with about an equal chance of success or
advantage.&nbsp; I politely decline.&nbsp; He insists; I turn him
off with a joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So you laugh at us, O you inhabitants of
towns.&nbsp; We are Bedouins, we do not know your customs,&rsquo;
replies he, in a whining tone; while the boys grin unconscionably
at the discomfiture of their tribesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ya woleyd,&rsquo; or young fellow (for so they
style every human male from eight to eighty without distinction),
&lsquo;will you not fill my pipe?&rsquo; says one, who has
observed that mine was not idle, and who, though well provided
with a good stock of dry tobacco tied up in a rag at his greasy
waist-belt, thinks the moment a fair opportunity for a little
begging, since neither medicine nor merchandise is to be had.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;But Salim, seated amid the circle, makes me a
sign not to comply.&nbsp; Accordingly, I evade the demand.&nbsp;
However, my petitioner goes on begging, and is imitated by two or
three others, each of whom thrusts forward (a true Irish hint) a
bit of marrowbone with a hole drilled in one side to act for a
pipe, or a porous stone, not uncommon throughout the desert,
clumsily fashioned into a smoking apparatus, a sort of primitive
meerschaum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As they grow rude, I pretend to become angry, thus to
cut the matter short.&nbsp; &lsquo;We are your guests, O you
Bedouins; are you not ashamed to beg of us?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Never mind, excuse us; those are ignorant fellows,
ill-bred clowns,&rsquo; etc., interposes one close by the
chief&rsquo;s side; and whose dress is in somewhat better
condition than that of the other half and three-quarter naked
individuals who complete the assembly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Will you not people the pipe for your little
brother?&rsquo; subjoins the chief himself, producing an empty
one with a modest air.&nbsp; Bedouin language, like that of most
Orientals, abounds with not ungraceful imagery, and accordingly,
&lsquo;people&rsquo; here means &lsquo;fill.&rsquo;&nbsp; Salim
gives me a wink of compliance.&nbsp; I take out a handful of
tobacco and put it on his long shirt-sleeve, which he knots over
it, and looks uncommonly well pleased.&nbsp; At any rate they are
easily satisfied, these Bedouins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night air in these wilds is life and health
itself.&nbsp; We sleep soundly, unharassed by the anticipation of
an early summons to march next morning, for both men and beasts
have alike need of a full <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>day&rsquo;s repose.&nbsp; When the
sun has risen we are invited to enter the chief&rsquo;s tent and
to bring our baggage under its shelter.&nbsp; A main object of
our entertainer, in proposing this move, is to try whether he
cannot render our visit some way profitable to himself, by
present or purchase.&nbsp; Whatever politeness he can muster is
accordingly brought into play, and a large bowl of fresh
camel&rsquo;s milk, an excellent beverage, now appears on the
stage.&nbsp; I leave to chemical analysis to decide why this milk
will not furnish butter, for such is the fact, and content myself
with bearing witness to its very nutritious and agreeable
qualities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day passes on.&nbsp; About noon our host naturally
enough supposes us hungry, and accordingly a new dish is brought
in: it looks much like a bowl full of coarse red paste, or bran
mixed with ochre.&nbsp; This is samh, a main article of
subsistence to the Bedouins of Northern Arabia.&nbsp; Throughout
this part of the desert grows a small herbaceous and tufted
plant, with juicy stalks and a little ovate yellow-tinted leaf;
the flowers are of a brighter yellow, with many stamens and
pistils.&nbsp; When the blossoms fall off there remains in place
of each a four-leaved capsule about the size of an ordinary pea,
and this, when ripe, opens to show a mass of minute reddish
seeds, resembling grit in feel and appearance, but farinaceous in
substance.&nbsp; The ripening season is in July, when old and
young, men and women, all are out to collect the unsown and
untoiled-for harvest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 27th of the month we passed with some difficulty
a series of abrupt sand-hills that close in <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>the direct
course of Wady Sirhan.&nbsp; Here, for the first time, we saw the
ghada, a shrub almost characteristic, from its very frequency, of
the Arabian Peninsula, and often alluded to by its poets.&nbsp;
It is of the genus <i>Euphorbia</i>, with a woody stem, often
five or six feet in height, and innumerable round green twigs,
very slender and flexible, forming a large feathery tuft, not
ungraceful to the eye, while it affords some kind of shelter to
the traveller and food to his camels.&nbsp; These last are
passionately fond of ghada, and will continually turn right out
of their way, in spite of blows and kicks, to crop a mouthful of
it, and then swing back their long necks into the former
direction, ready to repeat the same man&oelig;uvre at the next
bush, as though they had never received a beating for their past
voracity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, while in England, heard and read more than once
of the &lsquo;docile camel.&rsquo;&nbsp; If &lsquo;docile&rsquo;
means stupid, well and good; in such a case the camel is the very
model of docility.&nbsp; But if the epithet is intended to
designate an animal that takes an interest in its rider so far as
a beast can, that in some way understands his intentions or
shares them in a subordinate fashion, that obeys from a sort of
submissive or half fellow-feeling with his master, like the horse
and elephant, then I say that the camel is by no means docile,
very much the contrary; he takes no heed of his rider, pays no
attention whether he be on his back or not, walks straight on
when once set a-going, merely because he is too stupid to turn
aside; and then, should some tempting thorn or green branch
allure him out of the path, continues to walk on in <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>this new
direction simply because he is too dull to turn back into the
right road.&nbsp; His only care is to cross as much pasture as he
conveniently can while pacing mechanically onward; and for
effecting this, his long, flexible neck sets him at great
advantage, and a hard blow or a downright kick alone has any
influence on him whether to direct or impel.&nbsp; He will never
attempt to throw you off his back, such a trick being far beyond
his limited comprehension; but if you fall off, he will never
dream of stopping for you, and walks on just the same, grazing
while he goes, without knowing or caring an atom what has become
of you.&nbsp; If turned loose, it is a thousand to one that he
will never find his way back to his accustomed home or pasture,
and the first comer who picks him up will have no particular
shyness to get over; Jack or Tom is all the same to him, and the
loss of his old master, and of his own kith and kin, gives him no
regret, and occasions no endeavor to find them again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On coming in sight of the mountains of Djowf the travellers
were obliged to halt for two days at an encampment of the
Sherarat Arabs, because Salim could not enter the Djowf with them
in person, on account of a murder which he had committed
there.&nbsp; He was therefore obliged to procure them another
guide capable of conducting them safely the remainder of the
journey.&nbsp; After much search and discussion, Salim ended by
finding a good-natured, but somewhat timid, individual, who
undertook their guidance to the Djowf.</p>
<p>Journeying one whole day and night over an open <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>plateau,
where they saw a large troop of ostriches, they mounted again on
the 30th, by the light of the morning star, anxious to enter the
Djowf before the intense heat of noon should come on; &ldquo;but
we had yet a long way to go, and our track followed endless
windings among low hills and stony ledges, without any symptom of
approach to cultivated regions.&nbsp; At last the slopes grew
greener, and a small knot of houses, with traces of tillage close
by, appeared.&nbsp; It was the little village of Djoon, the most
westerly appendage of Djowf itself.&nbsp; I counted between
twenty and thirty houses.&nbsp; We next entered a long and narrow
pass, whose precipitous banks shut in the view on either
side.&nbsp; Suddenly several horsemen appeared on the opposite
cliff, and one of them, a handsome youth, with long, curling
hair, well armed and well mounted (we shall make his more special
acquaintance in the next chapter), called out to our guide to
halt, and answer in his own behalf and ours.&nbsp; This Suleyman
did, not without those marks of timidity in his voice and gesture
which a Bedouin seldom fails to show on his approach to a town,
for, when once in it, he is apt to sneak about much like a dog
who has just received a beating for theft.&nbsp; On his answer,
delivered in a most submissive tone, the horsemen held a brief
consultation, and we then saw two of them turn their
horses&rsquo; heads and gallop off in the direction of the Djowf,
while our original interlocutor called out to Suleyman,
&lsquo;All right, go on, and fear nothing,&rsquo; and then
disappeared after the rest of the band behind the verge of the
upland.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;We had yet to drag on for an hour of tedious
march; my camel fairly broke down, and fell again and again; his
bad example was followed by the coffee-laden beast; the heat was
terrible in these gorges, and noon was approaching.&nbsp; At last
we cleared the pass, but found the onward prospect still shut out
by an intervening mass of rocks.&nbsp; The water in our skins was
spent, and we had eaten nothing that morning.&nbsp; When shall we
get in sight of the Djowf? or has it flown away from before
us?&nbsp; While thus wearily laboring on our way we turned a huge
pile of crags, and a new and beautiful scene burst upon our
view.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;A broad, deep valley, descending ledge after ledge till
its innermost depths are hidden from sight amid far-reaching
shelves of reddish rock, below everywhere studded with tufts of
palm-groves and clustering fruit-trees, in dark-green patches,
down to the furthest end of its windings; a large brown mass of
irregular masonry crowning a central hill; beyond, a tall and
solitary tower overlooking the opposite bank of the hollow, and
further down small round turrets and flat house-tops, half buried
amid the garden foliage, the whole plunged in a perpendicular
flood of light and heat; such was the first aspect of the Djowf
as we now approached it from the west.&nbsp; It was a lovely
scene, and seemed yet more so to our eyes, weary of the long
desolation through which we had, with hardly an exception,
journeyed day after day, since our last farewell glimpse of Gaza
and Palestine, up to the first entrance on inhabited
Arabia.&nbsp; &lsquo;Like the Paradise of eternity, none can
enter it till after having previously passed over
hell-bridge,&rsquo; says <a name="page106"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 106</span>an Arab poet, describing some
similar locality in Algerian lands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reanimated by the view, we pushed on our jaded beasts,
and were already descending the first craggy slope of the valley
when two horsemen, well dressed and fully armed after the fashion
of these parts, came up toward us from the town, and at once
saluted us with a loud and hearty &lsquo;Marhaba,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;welcome;&rsquo; and without further preface they added,
&lsquo;Alight and eat,&rsquo; giving themselves the example of
the former by descending briskly from their light-limbed horses
and untying a large leather bag full of excellent dates and a
water-skin filled from the running spring; then, spreading out
these most opportune refreshments on the rock, and adding,
&lsquo;we were sure that you must be hungry and thirsty, so we
have come ready provided,&rsquo; they invited us once more to sit
down and begin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Residence in the Djowf</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> elder of the two cavaliers who
welcomed the travellers proved to be Ghafil-el-Haboob, the chief
of the most important family of the Djowf.&nbsp; Ghafil, and also
his companion, Dafee, invited the travellers to be his guests,
and the former, it afterward appeared, had intended that they
should reside in his house, hoping to make some profit from the
merchandise which they might have brought.&nbsp; They felt bound,
at least, to accompany him to his house and partake of coffee,
before going elsewhere.&nbsp; Palgrave thus describes the manner
of their reception:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The k&rsquo;hawah was a large, oblong hall, about
twenty feet in height, fifty in length, and sixteen, or
thereabouts, in breadth; the walls were colored in a rudely
decorative manner, with brown and white wash, and sunk here and
there into small triangular recesses, destined to the reception
of books&mdash;though of these Ghafil at least had no
over-abundance&mdash;lamps, and other such like objects.&nbsp;
The roof of timber, and flat; the floor was strewed with fine
clean sand, and garnished all round alongside of the walls with
long strips of carpet, upon which cushions, covered with faded
silk, were disposed at suitable intervals.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>&ldquo;We enter.&nbsp; On passing the threshold it is
proper to say, &lsquo;<i>Bismillah</i>,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>,
&lsquo;in the name of God;&rsquo; not to do so would be looked on
as a bad augury, alike for him who enters and for those
within.&nbsp; The visitor next advances in silence, till, on
coming about half-way across the room, he gives to all present,
but looking specially at the master of the house, the customary
&lsquo;<i>Es-salamu&rsquo;aleykum</i>,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Peace be
with you,&rsquo; literally, &lsquo;on you.&rsquo;&nbsp; All this
while everyone else in the room has kept his place, motionless,
and without saying a word.&nbsp; But on receiving the salaam of
etiquette, the master of the house rises, and if a strict
Wahabee, or at any rate desirous of seeming such, replies with
the full-length traditionary formula &lsquo;And with (or, on) you
be peace, and the mercy of God, and his blessings.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But should he happen to be of anti-Wahabee tendencies, the odds
are that he will say &lsquo;Marhaba,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ahlan
w&rsquo;sahlan,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i>, &lsquo;welcome,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;worthy and pleasurable,&rsquo; or the like; for of such
phrases there is an infinite but elegant variety.&nbsp; All
present follow the example thus given by rising and
saluting.&nbsp; The guest then goes up to the master of the
house, who has also made a step or two forward, and places his
open hand in the palm of his host&rsquo;s, but without grasping
or shaking, which would hardly pass as decorous, and, at the same
time each repeats once more his greeting, followed by the set
phrases of polite inquiry, &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;How goes the world with you?&rsquo; and so forth, all in a
tone of great interest, and to be gone over three or four times,
till one or other has the discretion to say &lsquo;El hamdu
Pillah,&rsquo; &lsquo;Praise be to <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>God,&rsquo; or, in equivalent value,
&lsquo;all right,&rsquo; and this is a signal for a seasonable
diversion to the ceremonious interrogatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meantime we have become engaged in active conversation
with our host and his friends.&nbsp; But our Sherarat guide,
Suleyman, like a true Bedouin, feels too awkward when among
townsfolk to venture on the upper places, though repeatedly
invited, and accordingly has squatted down on the sand near the
entrance.&nbsp; Many of Ghafil&rsquo;s relations are present;
their silver-decorated swords proclaim the importance of the
family.&nbsp; Others, too, have come to receive us, for our
arrival, announced beforehand by those we had met at the entrance
pass, is a sort of event in the town; the dress of some betokens
poverty, others are better clad, but all have a very polite and
decorous manner.&nbsp; Many a question is asked about our native
land and town, that is to say, Syria and Damascus, conformably to
the disguise already adopted, and which it was highly important
to keep well up; then follow inquiries regarding our journey, our
business, what we have brought with us, about our medicines, our
goods and wares, etc.&nbsp; From the very first it is easy for us
to perceive that patients and purchasers are likely to
abound.&nbsp; Very few travelling merchants, if any, visit the
Djowf at this time of year, for one must be mad, or next door to
it, to rush into the vast desert around during the heats of June
and July; I for one have certainly no intention of doing it
again.&nbsp; Hence we had small danger of competitors, and found
the market almost at our absolute disposal.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;But before a quarter of an hour has passed, and
while blacky is still roasting or pounding his coffee, a tall,
thin lad, Ghafil&rsquo;s eldest son, appears, charged with a
large circular dish, grass-platted like the rest, and throws it
with a graceful jerk on the sandy floor close before us.&nbsp; He
then produces a large wooden bowlful of dates, bearing in the
midst of the heap a cupful of melted butter; all this he places
on the circular mat, and says, &lsquo;Semmoo,&rsquo; literally,
&lsquo;pronounce the Name,&rsquo; of God, understood; this means
&lsquo;set to work at it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hereon the master of the
house quits his place by the fireside and seats himself on the
sand opposite to us; we draw nearer to the dish, and four or five
others, after some respectful coyness, join the circle.&nbsp;
Everyone then picks out a date or two from the juicy,
half-amalgamated mass, dips them into the butter, and thus goes
on eating till he has had enough, when he rises and washes his
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take the opportunity of leading my readers over
the whole of the Djowf, as a general view will help better to
understand what follows in the narrative, besides offering much
that will be in part new, I should fancy, to the greater
number.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This province is a sort of oasis, a large oval
depression of sixty or seventy miles long, by ten or twelve
broad, lying between the northern desert that separates it from
Syria and the Euphrates, and the southern Nefood, or sandy waste,
and interposed between it and the nearest mountains of the
central Arabian plateau.&nbsp; However, from its comparative
proximity to the latter, no less than from the <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>character
of its climate and productions, it belongs hardly so much to
Northern as to Central Arabia, of which it is a kind of porch or
vestibule.&nbsp; If an equilateral triangle were to be drawn,
having its base from Damascus to Bagdad, the vertex would find
itself pretty exactly as the Djowf, which is thus at a nearly
equal distance, southeast and southwest, from the two localities
just mentioned, while the same cross-line, if continued, will
give at about the same intervals of space in the opposite
direction, Medina on the one hand, and Zulphah, the great
commercial door of Eastern Nedjed, on the other.&nbsp; Djebel
Shomer lies almost due south, and much nearer than any other of
the places above specified.&nbsp; Partly to this central
position, and partly to its own excavated form, the province owes
its appropriate name of Djowf, or &lsquo;belly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The principal, or rather the only, town of the
district, all the rest being mere hamlets, bears the name of the
entire region.&nbsp; It is composed of eight villages, once
distinct, but which have in process of time coalesced into one,
and exchanged their separate existence and name for that of Sook,
or &lsquo;quarter,&rsquo; of the common borough.&nbsp; Of these
Sooks, the principal is that belonging to the family Haboob, and
in which we were now lodged.&nbsp; It includes the central castle
already mentioned, and numbers about four hundred houses.&nbsp;
The other quarters, some larger, others smaller, stretch up and
down the valley, but are connected together by their extensive
gardens.&nbsp; The entire length of the town thus formed, with
the cultivation immediately annexed, is full four <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>miles, but
the average breadth does not exceed half a mile, and sometimes
falls short of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The size of the domiciles varies with the condition of
their occupants, and the poor are contented with narrow lodgings,
though always separate; for I doubt if throughout the whole of
Arabia two families, however needy, inhabit the same
dwelling.&nbsp; Ghafil&rsquo;s abode, already described, may give
a fair idea of the better kind; in such we have an outer court,
for unlading camels and the like, an inner court, a large
reception-room, and several other smaller apartments, to which
entrance is given by a private door, and where the family itself
is lodged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But another and a very characteristic feature of
domestic architecture is the frequent addition, throughout the
Djowf, of a round tower, from thirty to forty feet in height and
twelve or more in breadth, with a narrow entrance and loop-holes
above.&nbsp; This construction is sometimes contiguous to the
dwelling-place, and sometimes isolated in a neighboring garden
belonging to the same master.&nbsp; These towers once answered
exactly the same purposes as the &lsquo;torri,&rsquo; well known
to travellers in many cities of Italy, at Bologna, Siena, Rome,
and elsewhere, and denoted a somewhat analogous state of society
to what formerly prevailed there.&nbsp; Hither, in time of the
ever-recurring feuds between rival chiefs and factions, the
leaders and their partisans used to retire for refuge and
defence, and hence they would make their sallies to burn and
destroy.&nbsp; These towers, like all the modern edifices of the
Djowf, are of unbaked bricks; their great thickness and solidity
of make, along <a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
113</span>with the extreme tenacity of the soil, joined to a very
dry climate, renders the material a rival almost of stone-work in
strength and endurance.&nbsp; Since the final occupation of this
region by the forces of Telal, all these towers have, without
exception, been rendered unfit for defence, and some are even
half-ruined.&nbsp; Here again the phenomena of Europe have
repeated themselves in Arabia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The houses are not unfrequently isolated each from the
other by their gardens and plantations; and this is especially
the case with the dwellings of chiefs and their families.&nbsp;
What has just been said about the towers renders the reasons of
this isolation sufficiently obvious.&nbsp; But the dwellings of
the commoner sort are generally clustered together, though
without symmetry or method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gardens of the Djowf are much celebrated in this
part of the East, and justly so.&nbsp; They are of a
productiveness and variety superior to those of Djebel Shomer or
of upper Nedjed, and far beyond whatever the Hedjaz and its
neighborhood can offer.&nbsp; Here, for the first time in our
southward course, we found the date-palm a main object of
cultivation; and if its produce be inferior to that of the same
tree in Nedjed and Hasa, it is far, very far, above whatever
Egypt, Africa, or the valley of the Tigris from Bagdad to Bassora
can show.&nbsp; However, the palm is by no means alone
here.&nbsp; The apricot and the peach, the fig-tree and the vine,
abound throughout these orchards, and their fruit surpasses in
copiousness and flavor that supplied by the gardens of Damascus
or the hills of Syria and Palestine.&nbsp; In <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>the
intervals between the trees or in the fields beyond, corn,
leguminous plants, gourds, melons, etc., etc., are widely
cultivated.&nbsp; Here, too, for the last time, the traveller
bound for the interior sees the irrigation indispensable to all
growth and tillage in this droughty climate kept up by running
streams of clear water, whereas in the Nedjed and its
neighborhood it has to be laboriously procured from wells and
cisterns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the Djowf itself, or capital, there exist
several other villages belonging to the same homonymous province,
and all subject to the same central governor.&nbsp; Of these the
largest is Sekakah; it lies at about twelve miles distant to the
northeast, and though inferior to the principal town in
importance and fertility of soil, almost equals it in the number
of its inhabitants.&nbsp; I should reckon the united population
of these two localities&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;at
about thirty-three or thirty-four thousand souls.&nbsp; This
calculation, like many others before us in the course of the
work, rests partly on an approximate survey of the number of
dwellings, partly on the military muster, and partly on what I
heard on the subject from the natives themselves.&nbsp; A census
is here unknown, and no register records birth, marriage, or
death.&nbsp; Yet, by aid of the war list, which generally
represents about one-tenth of the entire population, a fair
though not absolute idea may be obtained on this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lastly, around and at no great distance from these main
centres, are several small villages or hamlets, eight or ten in
number, as I was told, and <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>containing each of them from twenty
to fifty or sixty houses.&nbsp; But I had neither time nor
opportunity to visit each separately.&nbsp; They cluster round
lesser water springs, and offer in miniature features much
resembling those of the capital.&nbsp; The entire population of
the province cannot exceed forty or forty-two thousand, but it is
a brave one, and very liberally provided with the physical
endowments of which it has been acutely said that they are seldom
despised save by those who do not themselves possess them.&nbsp;
Tall, well-proportioned, of a tolerably fair complexion, set off
by long curling locks of jet-black hair, with features for the
most part regular and intelligent, and a dignified carriage, the
Djowfites are eminently good specimens of what may be called the
pure northern or Ishmaelitish Arab type, and in all these
respects they yield the palm to the inhabitants of Djebel Shomer
alone.&nbsp; Their large-developed forms and open countenance
contrast strongly with the somewhat dwarfish stature and
suspicious under-glance of the Bedouin.&nbsp; They are, besides,
a very healthy people, and keep up their strength and activity
even to an advanced age.&nbsp; It is no uncommon occurrence here,
to see an old man of seventy set out full-armed among a band of
youths; though, by the way, such &ldquo;green old age&rdquo; is
often to be met with also in the central province farther south,
as I have had frequent opportunity of witnessing.&nbsp; The
climate, too, is good and dry, and habits of out-door life
contribute not a little to the maintenance of health and
vigor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In manners, as in locality, the worthies of Djowf
occupy a sort of half-way position between Bedouins <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>and the
inhabitants of the cultivated districts.&nbsp; Thus they partake
largely in the nomad&rsquo;s aversion to mechanical occupations,
in his indifference to literary acquirements, in his aimless
fickleness too, and even in his treacherous ways.&nbsp; I have
said, in the preceding chapter, that while we were yet threading
the narrow gorge near the first entrance of the valley, several
horsemen appeared on the upper margin of the pass, and one of
them questioned our guide, and then, after a short consultation
with his companions, called out to us to go on and fear
nothing.&nbsp; Now, the name of this individual was
Suliman-ebn-Dahir, a very adventurous and fairly intelligent
young fellow, with whom next-door neighborhood and frequent
intercourse rendered us intimate during our stay at the
Djowf.&nbsp; One day, while we were engaged in friendly
conversation, he said, half laughing, &lsquo;Do you know what we
were consulting about while you were in the pass below on the
morning of your arrival?&nbsp; It was whether we should make you
a good reception, and thus procure ourselves the advantage of
having you residents among us, or whether we should not do better
to kill you all three, and take our gain from the booty to be
found in your baggage.&rsquo;&nbsp; I replied with equal
coolness, &lsquo;It might have proved an awkward affair for
yourself and your friends, since Hamood your governor could
hardly have failed to get wind of the matter, and would have
taken it out of you.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; replied our
friend, &lsquo;never a bit; as if a present out of the plunder
would not have tied Hamood&rsquo;s tongue.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bedouins that you are,&rsquo; said I, laughing.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Of course we are,&rsquo; answered <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>Suliman,
&lsquo;for such we all were till quite lately, and the present
system is too recent to have much changed us.&rsquo;&nbsp;
However, he admitted that they all had, on second thoughts,
congratulated themselves on not having preferred bloodshed to
hospitality, though perhaps the better resolution was rather
owing to interested than to moral motives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most distinctive good feature of the inhabitants of
Djowf is their liberality.&nbsp; Nowhere else, even in Arabia, is
the guest, so at least he be not murdered before admittance,
better treated, or more cordially invited to become in every way
one of themselves.&nbsp; Courage, too, no one denies them, and
they are equally lavish of their own lives and property as of
their neighbors&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now resume the narrative.&nbsp; On the morning
after our arrival&mdash;it was now the 1st of July&mdash;Ghafil
caused a small house in the neighborhood, belonging to one of his
dependents, to be put at our entire disposal, according to our
previous request.&nbsp; This, our new abode, consisted of a small
court with two rooms, one on each side, for warehouse and
habitation, the whole being surrounded with an outer wall, whose
door was closed by lock and bolt.&nbsp; Of a kitchen-room there
was small need, so constant and hospitable are the invitations of
the good folks here to strangers; and if our house was not over
capacious, it afforded at least what we most desired, namely,
seclusion and privacy at will; it was, moreover, at our
host&rsquo;s cost, rent and reparations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hither, accordingly, we transferred baggage and
chattels, and arranged everything as comfortably as <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>we best
could.&nbsp; And as we had already concluded, from the style and
conversation of those around us, that their state of society was
hardly far enough advanced to offer a sufficiently good prospect
for medical art, whose exercise, to be generally advantageous,
requires a certain amount of culture and aptitude in the patient,
no less than of skill in the physician, we resolved to make
commerce our main affair here, trusting that by so doing we
should gain a second advantage, that of lightening our more bulky
goods, such as coffee and cloth, whose transport had already
annoyed us not a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in fact we were not more desirous to sell than the
men, women, and children of the Djowf were to buy.&nbsp; From the
very outset our little courtyard was crowded with customers, and
the most amusing scenes of Arab haggling, in all its mixed
shrewdness and simplicity, diverted us through the week.&nbsp;
Handkerchief after handkerchief, yard after yard of cloth, beads
for the women, knives, combs, looking-glasses, and what not? (for
our stock was a thorough miscellany) were soon sold off, some for
ready money, others on credit; and it is but justice to say that
all debts so contracted were soon paid in very honestly; Oxford
High Street tradesmen, at least in former times, were not always
equally fortunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile we had the very best opportunity of becoming
acquainted with and appreciating all classes, nay, almost all
individuals, of the place.&nbsp; Peasants, too, from various
hamlets arrived, led by rumor, whose trumpet, prone to exaggerate
under every sky, <a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>had proclaimed us throughout the valley of Djowf for
much more important characters, and possessed of a much larger
stock in hand, than was really the case.&nbsp; All crowded in,
and before long there were more customers than wares assembled in
the storeroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our manner of passing the time was as follows: We used
to rise at early dawn, lock up the house, and go out in the pure
cool air of the morning to some quiet spot among the neighboring
palm-groves, or scale the wall of some garden, or pass right on
through the by-lanes to where cultivation merges in the adjoining
sands of the valley; in short, to any convenient place where we
might hope to pass an hour of quiet, undisturbed by Arab
sociability, and have leisure to plan our work for the day.&nbsp;
We would then return home about sunrise, and find outside the
door some tall lad sent by his father, generally one of the
wealthier and more influential inhabitants of the quarter yet
unvisited by us, waiting our return, to invite us to an early
breakfast.&nbsp; We would now accompany our Mercury to his
domicile, where a hearty reception, and some neighbors collected
for the occasion, or attracted by a cup of good coffee, were sure
to be in attendance.&nbsp; Here an hour or so would wear away,
and some medical or mercantile transaction be sketched out.&nbsp;
We, of course, would bring the conversation, whenever it was
possible, on local topics, according as those present seemed
likely to afford us exact knowledge and insight into the real
state and circumstances of the land.&nbsp; We would then return
to our own quarters, <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>where a crowd of customers, awaiting
us, would allow us neither rest nor pause till noon.&nbsp; Then a
short interval for date or pumpkin eating in some
neighbor&rsquo;s house would occur, and after that business be
again resumed for three or four hours.&nbsp; A walk among the
gardens, rarely alone, more often in company with friends and
acquaintances, would follow; and meanwhile an invitation to
supper somewhere had unfailingly been given and
accepted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After supper all rise, wash their hands, and then go
out into the open air to sit and smoke a quiet pipe under the
still transparent sky of the summer evening.&nbsp; Neither mist
nor vapor, much less a cloud, appears; the moon dips down in
silvery whiteness to the very verge of the palm-tree tops, and
the last rays of daylight are almost as sharp and clear as the
dawn itself.&nbsp; Chat and society continue for an hour or two,
and then everyone goes home, most to sleep, I fancy, for few
Penseroso lamps are here to be seen at midnight hour, nor does
the spirit of Plato stand much risk of unsphering from the
nocturnal studies of the Djowf; we, to write our journal, or to
compare observations and estimate characters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes a comfortable landed proprietor would invite
us to pass an extemporary holiday morning in his garden, or
rather orchard, there to eat grapes and enjoy ourselves at will,
seated under clustering vine-trellises, with palm-trees above and
running streams around.&nbsp; How pleasant it was after the
desert!&nbsp; At other times visits of patients, prescriptions,
and similar duties would take up a part of the day; or some young
fellow, particularly desirous of information <a
name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>about Syria
or Egypt, or perhaps curious after history and moral science,
would hold us for a couple of hours in serious and sensible talk,
at any rate to our advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was necessary that the travellers should not delay in
paying their official visit to Hamood, the vice-gerent of
Telal.&nbsp; His residence is in the centre of the garden region,
near a solitary round tower, whose massive stone walls are
mentioned in Arabian poetry.&nbsp; Hamood&rsquo;s residence is an
irregular structure, of more recent date, with no distinguishing
feature except a tower about fifty feet in height.&nbsp; Palgrave
and his companion were accompanied by a large number of their
newly-found friends.&nbsp; After passing through an outer court,
filled with armed guards, they found the ruler seated in his
large reception-hall:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, in the place of distinction, which he never
yields to any individual of Djowf, whatever be his birth or
wealth, appeared the governor, a strong, broad-shouldered,
dark-browed, dark-eyed man, clad in the long white shirt of the
country, and over it a handsome black cloak, embroidered with
crimson silk; on his august head a silken handkerchief or
<i>keffee&rsquo;yeh</i>, girt by a white band of finely woven
camel&rsquo;s hair; and in his fingers a grass fan.&nbsp; He rose
graciously on our approach, extended to us the palm of his hand,
and made us sit down near his side, keeping, however, Ghafil, as
an old acquaintance, between himself and us, perhaps as a
precautionary arrangement against any sudden assault or
treasonable intention on our part, for an Arab, be he who he may,
is never off his guard when new faces <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>are in presence.&nbsp; In other
respects he showed us much courtesy and good-will, made many
civil inquiries about our health after so fatiguing a journey,
praised Damascus and the Damascenes, by way of an indirect
compliment, and offered us a lodging in the castle.&nbsp; But
here Ghafil availed himself of the privileges conceded by Arab
custom to priority of host-ship to put in his negative on our
behalf; nor were we anxious to press the matter.&nbsp; A pound or
so of our choicest coffee, with which we on this occasion
presented his excellency, both as a mute witness to the object of
our journey, and the better to secure his good-will, was accepted
very readily by the great man, who in due return offered us his
best services.&nbsp; We replied that we stood in need of nothing
save his long life, this being the Arab formula for rejoinder to
such fair speeches; and, next in order, of means to get safe on
to Ha&rsquo;yel so soon as our business at the Djowf should
permit, being desirous to establish ourselves under the immediate
patronage of Telal.&nbsp; In this he promised to aid us, and kept
his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hamood afterward politely returned their visit, and they
frequently went to his castle for the purpose of studying the
many interesting scenes presented by the exercise of the very
primitive Arab system of justice.&nbsp; Palgrave gives the
following case as a specimen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One day my comrade and myself were on a visit of mere
politeness at the castle; the customary ceremonies had been gone
through, and business, at first interrupted by our entrance, had
resumed its course.&nbsp; A Bedouin of the Ma&rsquo;az tribe was
pleading his cause <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>before Hamood, and accusing someone of having forcibly
taken away his camel.&nbsp; The governor was seated with an air
of intense gravity in his corner, half leaning on a cushion,
while the Bedouin, cross-legged on the ground before him, and
within six feet of his person, flourished in his hand a large
reaping-hook, identically that which is here used for cutting
grass.&nbsp; Energetically gesticulating with this graceful
implement, he thus challenged his judge&rsquo;s attention:
&lsquo;You, Hamood, do you hear?&rsquo; (stretching out at the
same time the hook toward the governor, so as almost to reach his
body, as though he meant to rip him open); &lsquo;he has taken
from me my camel; have you called God to mind?&rsquo; (again
putting his weapon close to the unflinching magistrate).&nbsp;
&lsquo;The camel is my camel; do you hear?&rsquo; (with another
reminder from the reaping-hook); &lsquo;he is mine, by
God&rsquo;s award, and yours too; do you hear, child?&rsquo; and
so on, while Hamood sat without moving a muscle of face or limb,
imperturbable and impassible till some one of the counsellors
quieted the plaintiff with &lsquo;Remember God, child; it is of
no consequence, you shall not be wronged.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then the
judge called on the witnesses, men of the Djowf, to say their
say, and on their confirmation of the Bedouin&rsquo;s statement,
gave orders to two of his satellites to search for and bring
before him the accused party; while he added to the
Ma&rsquo;azee, &lsquo;All right, daddy, you shall have your own;
put your confidence in God,&rsquo; and composedly motioned him
back to his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fortnight and more went by, and found us still in the
Djowf, &lsquo;honored guests&rsquo; in Arab phrase, and <a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>well rested
from the bygone fatigues of the desert.&nbsp; Ghafil&rsquo;s
dwelling was still, so to speak, our official home; but there
were two other houses where we were still more at our ease; that
of Dafee, the same who along with Ghafil came to meet us on our
first arrival; and that of Salim, a respectable and, in his way,
a literary old man, our near neighbor, and surrounded by a large
family of fine strapping youths, all of them brought up more or
less in the fear of Allah and in good example.&nbsp; Hither we
used to retire when wearied of Ghafil and his like, and pass a
quiet hour in their k&rsquo;hawah, reciting or hearing Arab
poetry, talking over the condition of the country and its future
prospects, discussing points of morality, or commenting on the
ways and fashions of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The important question for the travellers was how they should
get to Djebel Shomer, the great fertile oasis to the south, under
the rule of the famous Prince Telal.&nbsp; The terrible
<i>Nefood</i>, or sand-passes, which the Arabs themselves look
upon with dread, must be crossed, and it was now the middle of
summer.&nbsp; The hospitable people of the Djowf begged Palgrave
and his friends to remain until September, and they probably
would have been delayed for some time but for a lucky
chance.&nbsp; The Azzam tribe of Bedouins, which had been
attacked by Prince Telal, submitted, and a dozen of their chiefs
arrived at the Djowf, on their way to Djebel Shomer, where they
purposed to win Telal&rsquo;s good graces by tendering him their
allegiance in his very capital.&nbsp; Hamood received them and
lodged them for several days, while they rested from their past
fatigues, and prepared <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>themselves for what yet lay before
them.&nbsp; Some inhabitants of the Djowf, whose business
required their presence at Ha&rsquo;yel, were to join the
party.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hamood sent for us,&rdquo; Palgrave
continues, &ldquo;and gave us notice of this expedition, and on
our declaring that we desired to profit by it, he handed us a
scrap of paper, addressed to Telal himself, wherein he certified
that we had duly paid the entrance fee exacted from strangers on
their coming within the limits of Shomer rule, and that we were
indeed respectable individuals, worthy of all good
treatment.&nbsp; We then, in presence of Hamood, struck our
bargain with one of the band for a couple of camels, whose price,
including all the services of their master as guide and companion
for ten days of July travelling, was not extravagant either; it
came up to just a hundred and ten piastres, equivalent to
eighteen or nineteen shillings of English money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many delays occurred, and it was not till the 18th of
July, when the figs were fully ripe&mdash;a circumstance which
furnished the natives of Djowf with new cause of wonder at our
rushing away, in lieu of waiting like rational beings to enjoy
the good things of the land&mdash;that we received our final
&lsquo;Son of Hodeirah, depart.&rsquo;&nbsp; This was intimated
to us, not by a locust, but by a creature almost as queer,
namely, our new conductor, a half-cracked Arab, neither peasant
nor Bedouin, but something anomalous between the two, hight
Djedey&rsquo;, and a native of the outskirts of Djebel Shomer,
who darkened our door in the forenoon, and warned us to make our
final packing up, and get ready for starting the same day.</p>
<p><a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;When once clear of the houses and gardens,
Djedey&rsquo; led us by a road skirting the southern side of the
valley, till we arrived, before sunset, at the other, or eastern,
extremity of the town.&nbsp; Here was the rendezvous agreed on by
our companions; but they did not appear, and reason good, for
they had right to a supper more under Hamood&rsquo;s roof, and
were loath to lose it.&nbsp; So we halted and alighted
alone.&nbsp; The chief of this quarter, which is above two miles
distant from the castle, invited us to supper, and thence we
returned to our baggage, there to sleep.&nbsp; To pass a
summer&rsquo;s night in the open air on a soft sand bed implies
no great privation in these countries, nor is anyone looked on as
a hero for so doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early next morning, while Venus yet shone like a drop
of melted silver on the slaty blue, three of our party arrived
and announced that the rest of our companions would soon come
up.&nbsp; Encouraged by the news, we determined to march on
without further tarrying, and ere sunrise we climbed the steep
ascent of the southerly bank, whence we had a magnificent view of
the whole length of the Djowf, its castle and towers, and groves
and gardens, in the ruddy light of morning, and beyond the drear
northern deserts stretching far away.&nbsp; We then dipped down
the other side of the bordering hill, not again to see the Djowf
till&mdash;who knows when?&rdquo;</p>

127</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Crossing the Nefood</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Our</span> way was now to the
southeast, across a large plain varied with sand-mounds and
covered with the ghada-bush, already described, so that our
camels were much more inclined to crop pasture than to do their
business in journeying ahead.&nbsp; About noon we halted near a
large tuft of this shrub, at least ten feet high.&nbsp; We
constructed a sort of cabin with boughs broken off the
neighboring plants and suitably arranged shedwise, and thus
passed the noon hours of intolerable heat till the whole band
came in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were barbarous, nay, almost savage, fellows, like
most Sherarat, whether chiefs or people; but they had been
somewhat awed by the grandeurs of Hamood, and yet more so by the
prospect of coming so soon before the terrible majesty of Telal
himself.&nbsp; All were duly armed, and had put on their best
suits of apparel, an equipment worthy of a scarecrow or of an
Irishman at a wake.&nbsp; Tattered red overalls; cloaks with more
patches than original substance, or, worse yet, which opened
large mouths to cry for patching, but had not got it; little
broken tobacco pipes, and no trousers soever (by the way, all
genuine Arabs are <i>sans-culottes</i>); faces meagre <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>with
habitual hunger, and black with dirt and weather
stains&mdash;such were the high-born chiefs of Azzam, on their
way to the king&rsquo;s levee.&nbsp; Along with them were two
Bedouins of the Shomer tribe, a degree better in guise and person
than the Sherarat; and lastly, three men of Djowf, who looked
almost like gentlemen among such ragamuffins.&nbsp; As to my
comrade and myself, I trust that the reader will charitably
suppose us the exquisites of the party.&nbsp; So we rode on
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning, a little after sunrise, we arrived at a
white calcareous valley, girt round with low hills of marl and
sand.&nbsp; Here was the famous Be&rsquo;er Shekeek, or
&lsquo;well of Shekeek,&rsquo; whence we were to fill our
water-skins, and that thoroughly, since no other source lay
before us for four days&rsquo; march amid the sand passes, up to
the very verge of Djebel Shomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughters of the Great Desert, to use an Arab phrase,
the &lsquo;Nefood,&rsquo; or sand-passes, bear but too strong a
family resemblance to their unamiable mother.&nbsp; What has been
said elsewhere about their origin, their extent, their bearings,
and their connection with the Dhana, or main sand-waste of the
south, may exempt me from here entering on a minute enarration of
all their geographical details; let it suffice for the present
that they are offshoots&mdash;inlets, one might not unsuitably
call them&mdash;of the great ocean of sand that covers about
one-third of the peninsula, into whose central and comparatively
fertile plateau they make deep inroads, nay, in some places
almost intersect it.&nbsp; Their general character, of which <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>the
following pages will, I trust, give a tolerably correct idea, is
also that of Dahna, or &lsquo;red desert,&rsquo; itself.&nbsp;
The Arabs, always prone to localize rather than generalize, count
these sand-streams by scores, but they may all be referred to
four principal courses, and he who would traverse the centre must
necessarily cross two of them, perhaps even three, as we did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The general type of Arabia is that of a central
table-land, surrounded by a desert ring, sandy to the south,
west, and east, and stony to the north.&nbsp; This outlying
circle is in its turn girt by a line of mountains, low and
sterile for the most, but attaining in Yemen and Oman
considerable height, breadth, and fertility, while beyond these a
narrow rim of coast is bordered by the sea.&nbsp; The surface of
the midmost table-land equals somewhat less than one-half of the
entire peninsula, and its special demarcations are much affected,
nay, often absolutely fixed, by the windings and in-runnings of
the Nefood.&nbsp; If to these central highlands, or Nedjed,
taking that word in its wider sense, we add the Djowf, the
Ta&rsquo;yif, Djebel &rsquo;Aaseer, Yemen, Oman, and Hasa, in
short, whatever spots of fertility belong to the outer circles,
we shall find that Arabia contains about two-thirds of
cultivated, or at least of cultivable, land, with a remaining
third of irreclaimable desert, chiefly to the south.&nbsp; In
most other directions the great blank spaces often left in maps
of this country are quite as frequently indications of
non-information as of real non-inhabitation.&nbsp; However, we
have just now a strip, though fortunately only a strip, of pure,
unmitigated desert before us, after which better lands await us;
and in <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>this hope let us take courage and boldly enter the
Nefood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much had we heard of them from Bedouins and countrymen,
so that we had made up our minds to something very terrible and
very impracticable.&nbsp; But the reality, especially in these
dog days, proved worse than aught heard or imagined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were now traversing an immense ocean of loose
reddish sand, unlimited to the eye, and heaped up in enormous
ridges, running parallel to each other from north to south,
undulation after undulation, each swell two or three hundred feet
in average height, with slant sides and rounded crests furrowed
in every direction by the capricious gales of the desert.&nbsp;
In the depths between the traveller finds himself as it were
imprisoned in a suffocating sand-pit, hemmed in by burning walls
on every side; while at other times, while laboring up the slope,
he overlooks what seems a vast sea of fire, swelling under a
heavy monsoon wind, and ruffled by a cross blast into little
red-hot waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palgrave devotes several pages to his journey across the
Nefood, bearing out in his general description its character, as
above.</p>
<p>Lady Anne Blunt, who with her husband and native followers
crossed the Nefood sixteen years later, however, takes issue with
Mr. Palgrave as to its character, as will be found in Chapter
XVII., largely devoted to her travels in Arabia.</p>
<p>Arriving at the eastern edge of the Nefood Palgrave
continues:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning broke on us still toiling amid the <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>sands.&nbsp; By daylight we saw our straggling
companions like black specks here and there, one far ahead on a
yet vigorous dromedary, another in the rear dismounted, and
urging his fallen beast to rise by plunging a knife a good inch
deep into its haunches, a third lagging in the extreme
distance.&nbsp; Everyone for himself and God for us all!&mdash;so
we quickened our pace, looking anxiously before us for the hills
of Djobbah, which could not now be distant.&nbsp; At noon we came
in sight of them all at once, close on our right, wild and
fantastic cliffs, rising sheer on the margin of the sand
sea.&nbsp; We coasted them awhile, till at a turn the whole plain
of Djobbah and its landscape opened on our view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we had before us a cluster of black granite rock,
streaked with red, and about seven hundred feet, at a rough
guess, in height; beyond them a large barren plain, partly white
and encrusted with salt, partly green with tillage, and studded
with palm-groves, amongst which we could discern, not far off,
the village of Djobbah, much resembling that of Djowf in
arrangement and general appearance, only smaller, and without
castle or tower.&nbsp; Beyond the valley glistened a second line
of sand-hills, but less wild and desolate-looking than those
behind us, and far in the distance the main range of Djebel
Shomer, a long purple sierra of most picturesque outline.&nbsp;
Had we there and then mounted, as we afterward did, the heights
on our right, we should have also seen in the extreme southwest a
green patch near the horizon, where cluster the palm plantations
of Teymah, a place famed in Arab history, and by <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>some
supposed identical with the Teman of Holy Writ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for the moment a drop of fresh water and a shelter
from the July sun was much more in our thoughts than all the
Teymahs or Temans that ever existed.&nbsp; My camel, too,
was&mdash;not at the end of his wits, for he never had
any&mdash;but of his legs, and hardly capable of advance, while I
was myself too tired to urge him on vigorously, and we took a
fair hour to cross a narrow white strip of mingled salt and sand
that yet intervened between us and the village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without its garden walls was pitched the very identical
tent of our noble guide, and here his wife and family were
anxiously awaiting their lord.&nbsp; Djedey&rsquo; invited
us&mdash;indeed he could not conformably with Shomer customs do
less&mdash;to partake of his board and lodging, and we had no
better course than to accept of both.&nbsp; So we let our camels
fling themselves out like dead or dying alongside of the
tabernacle, and entered to drink water mixed with sour
milk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the caravan rested for a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About sunrise on the 25th of July we left Djobbah,
crossed the valley to the southeast, and entered once more on a
sandy desert, but a desert, as I have before hinted, of a milder
and less inhospitable character than the dreary Nefood of two
days back.&nbsp; Here the sand is thickly sprinkled with shrubs
and not altogether devoid of herbs and grass; while the
undulations of the surface, running invariably from north to
south, according to the general rule of that phenomenon, are much
less deeply traced, though never wholly absent.&nbsp; <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>We paced on
all day; at nightfall we found ourselves on the edge of a vast
funnel-like depression, where the sand recedes on all sides to
leave bare the chalky bottom-strata below; here lights glimmering
amid Bedouin tents in the depths of the valley invited us to try
our chance of a preliminary supper before the repose of the
night.&nbsp; We had, however, much ado to descend the cavity, so
steep was the sandy slope; while its circular form and spiral
marking reminded me of Edgar Poe&rsquo;s imaginative
&lsquo;Maelstrom.&rsquo;&nbsp; The Arabs to whom the watch-fires
belonged were shepherds of the numerous Shomer tribe, whence the
district, plain and mountain, takes its name.&nbsp; They welcomed
us to a share of their supper; and a good dish of rice, instead
of insipid samh or pasty, augured a certain approach to
civilization.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At break of day we resumed our march, and met with
camels and camel-drivers in abundance, besides a few sheep and
goats.&nbsp; Before noon we had got clear of the sandy patch, and
entered in its stead on a firm gravelly soil.&nbsp; Here we
enjoyed an hour of midday halt and shade in a natural cavern,
hollowed out in a high granite rock, itself an advanced guard of
the main body of Djebel Shomer.&nbsp; This mountain range now
rose before us, wholly unlike any other that I had ever seen; a
huge mass of crag and stone, piled up in fantastic disorder, with
green valleys and habitations intervening.&nbsp; The sun had not
yet set when we reached the pretty village of Kenah, amid groves
and waters&mdash;no more, however, running streams like those of
Djowf, but an artificial irrigation by means of wells and
buckets.&nbsp; At some <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>distance from the houses stood a
cluster of three or four large overshadowing trees, objects of
peasant veneration here, as once in Palestine.&nbsp; The welcome
of the inhabitants, when we dismounted at their doors, was hearty
and hospitable, nay, even polite and considerate; and a good
meal, with a dish of fresh grapes for dessert, was soon set
before us in the veranda of a pleasant little house, much
reminding me of an English farm-cottage, whither the good man of
the dwelling had invited us for the evening.&nbsp; All expressed
great desire to profit by our medical skill; and on our reply
that we could not conveniently open shop except at the capital,
Ha&rsquo;yel, several announced their resolution to visit us
there; and subsequently kept their word, though at the cost of
about twenty-four miles of journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rose very early.&nbsp; Our path, well tracked and
trodden, now lay between ridges of precipitous rock, rising
abruptly from a level and grassy plain; sometimes the road was
sunk in deep gorges, sometimes it opened out on wider spaces,
where trees and villages appeared, while the number of wayfarers,
on foot or mounted, single or in bands, still increased as we
drew nearer to the capital.&nbsp; There was an air of newness and
security about the dwellings and plantations hardly to be found
nowadays in any other part of Arabia, Oman alone excepted.&nbsp;
I may add also the great frequency of young trees and ground
newly enclosed, a cheerful sight, yet further enhanced by the
total absence of ruins, so common in the East; hence the general
effect produced by Djebel Shomer, when contrasted with most other
<a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>provinces or kingdoms around, near and far, is that of
a newly coined piece, in all its sharpness and shine, amid a
dingy heap of defaced currency.&nbsp; It is a fresh creation, and
shows what Arabia might be under better rule than it enjoys for
the most part: an inference rendered the more conclusive by the
fact that in natural and unaided fertility Djebel Shomer is
perhaps the least favored district in the entire central
peninsula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were here close under the backbone of Djebel Shomer,
whose reddish crags rose in the strangest forms on our right and
left, while a narrow cleft down to the plain-level below gave
opening to the capital.&nbsp; Very hard to bring an army through
this against the will of the inhabitants thought I; fifty
resolute men could, in fact, hold the pass against thousands; nor
is there any other approach to Ha&rsquo;yel from the northern
direction.&nbsp; The town is situated near the very centre of the
mountains; it was as yet entirely concealed from our view by the
windings of the road amid huge piles of rock.&nbsp; Meanwhile
from Djobbah to Ha&rsquo;yel the whole plain gradually rises,
running up between the sierras, whose course from northeast to
southwest crosses two-thirds of the upper peninsula, and forms
the outwork of the central high country.&nbsp; Hence the name of
Nedjed, literally &lsquo;highland,&rsquo; in contradistinction to
the coast and the outlying provinces of lesser elevation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun was yet two hours&rsquo; distance above the
western horizon, when we threaded the narrow and winding defile,
till we arrived at its farther end.&nbsp; <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>Here we
found ourselves on the verge of a large plain, many miles in
length and breadth, and girt on every side by a high mountain
rampart, while right in front of us, at scarce a quarter of an
hour&rsquo;s march, lay the town of Ha&rsquo;yel, surrounded by
fortifications of about twenty feet in height, with bastion
towers, some round, some square, and large folding gates at
intervals; it offered the same show of freshness, and even of
something like irregular elegance, that had before struck us in
the villages on our way.&nbsp; This, however, was a full-grown
town, and its area might readily hold three hundred thousand
inhabitants or more, were its streets and houses close packed
like those of Brussels or Paris.&nbsp; But the number of citizens
does not, in fact, exceed twenty or twenty-two thousand, thanks
to the many large gardens, open spaces, and even plantations,
included within the outer walls, while the immense palace of the
monarch alone, with its pleasure-grounds annexed, occupies about
one-tenth of the entire city.&nbsp; Our attention was attracted
by a lofty tower, some seventy feet in height, of recent
construction and oval form, belonging to the royal
residence.&nbsp; The plain all around the town is studded with
isolated houses and gardens, the property of wealthy citizens, or
of members of the kingly family, and on the far-off skirts of the
plain appear the groves belonging to Kafar, &rsquo;Adwah, and
other villages, placed at the openings of the mountain gorges
that conduct to the capital.&nbsp; The town walls and buildings
shone yellow in the evening sun, and the whole prospect was one
of thriving security, delightful to view, though wanting in the
<a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>peculiar
luxuriance of vegetation offered by the valley of Djowf.&nbsp; A
few Bedouin tents lay clustered close by the ramparts, and the
great number of horsemen, footmen, camels, asses, peasants,
townsmen, boys, women, and other like, all passing to and fro on
their various avocations, gave cheerfulness and animation to the
scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We crossed the plain and made for the town gate,
opposite the castle; next, with no little difficulty, prevailed
on our camels to pace the high-walled street, and at last arrived
at the open space in front of the palace.&nbsp; It was yet an
hour before sunset, or rather more; the business of the day was
over in Ha&rsquo;yel, and the outer courtyard where we now stood
was crowded with loiterers of all shapes and sizes.&nbsp; We made
our camels kneel down close by the palace gate, alongside of some
forty or fifty others, and then stepped back to repose our very
weary limbs on a stone bench opposite the portal, and awaited
what might next occur.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Life in Ha&rsquo;yel</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">At</span> our first appearance a
slight stir takes place.&nbsp; The customary salutations are
given and returned by those nearest at hand; and a small knot of
inquisitive idlers, come up to see what and whence we are, soon
thickens into a dense circle.&nbsp; Many questions are asked,
first of our conductor, Djedey&rsquo;, and next of ourselves; our
answers are tolerably laconic.&nbsp; Meanwhile a thin,
middle-sized individual, whose countenance bears the type of
smiling urbanity and precise etiquette, befitting his office at
court, approaches us.&nbsp; His neat and simple dress, the long
silver-circled staff in his hand, his respectful salutation, his
politely important manner, all denote him one of the palace
retinue.&nbsp; It is Seyf, the court chamberlain, whose special
duty is the reception and presentation of strangers.&nbsp; We
rise to receive him, and are greeted with a decorous &lsquo;Peace
be with you, brothers,&rsquo; in the fulness of every inflection
and accent that the most scrupulous grammarian could
desire.&nbsp; We return an equally Priscianic salutation.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Whence have you come?&rsquo; is the first question.&nbsp;
&lsquo;May good attend you!&rsquo;&nbsp; Of course we declare
ourselves physicians from Syria, for our bulkier wares had <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>been
disposed of in the Djowf, and we were now resolved to depend on
medical practice alone.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what do you desire here
in our town? may God grant you success!&rsquo; says Seyf.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We desire the favor of God most high, and, secondly, that
of Telal,&rsquo; is our answer, conforming our style to the
correctest formulas of the country, which we had already begun to
pick up.&nbsp; Whereupon Seyf, looking very sweet the while,
begins, as in duty bound, a little encomium on his master&rsquo;s
generosity and other excellent qualities, and assures us that we
have exactly reached right quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But alas! while my comrade and myself were exchanging
side-glances of mutual felicitation at such fair beginnings,
Nemesis suddenly awoke to claim her due, and the serenity of our
horizon was at once overcast by an unexpected and most unwelcome
cloud.&nbsp; My readers are doubtless already aware that nothing
was of higher importance for us than the most absolute incognito,
above all in whatever regarded European origin and
character.&nbsp; In fact, once known for Europeans, all intimate
access and sincerity of intercourse with the people of the land
would have been irretrievably lost, and our onward progress to
Nedjed rendered totally impossible.&nbsp; These were the very
least inconveniences that could follow such a detection; others
much more disagreeable might also be well apprehended.&nbsp; Now
thus far nothing had occurred capable of exciting serious
suspicion; no one had recognized us, or pretended to
recognize.&nbsp; We, too, on our part, had thought that Gaza,
Ma&rsquo;an, and perhaps the Djowf, were the only localities <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>where this
kind of recognition had to be feared.&nbsp; But we had reckoned
without our host; the first real danger was reserved for
Ha&rsquo;yel, within the very limits of Nedjed, and with all the
desert-belt between us and our old acquaintances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For while Seyf was running through the preliminaries of
his politeness, I saw to my horror, amid the circle of
bystanders, a figure, a face well known to me scarce six months
before in Damascus, and well known to many others also, now
merchant, now trader, now post-contractor, shrewd, enterprising,
and active, though nigh fifty years of age, and intimate with
many Europeans of considerable standing in Syria and
Bagdad&mdash;one, in short, accustomed to all kinds of men, and
not to be easily imposed on by any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I involuntarily stared dismay on my friend, and
yet doubted if it could possibly be he, all incertitude was
dispelled by his cheerful salutation, in the confidential tone of
an old acquaintance, followed by wondering inquiries as to what
wind had blown me hither, and what I meant to do here in
Ha&rsquo;yel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wishing him most heartily somewhere else, I had nothing
for it but to &lsquo;fix a vacant stare,&rsquo; to give a formal
return of greeting, and then silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But misfortunes never come single.&nbsp; While I was
thus on my defensive against so dangerous an antagonist in the
person of my free-and-easy friend, lo! a tall, sinister-featured
individual comes up, clad in the dress of an inhabitant of
Kaseem, and abruptly breaks in with, &lsquo;And I too have seen
him <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>at
Damascus,&rsquo; naming at the same time the place and date of
the meeting, and specifying exactly the circumstances most
calculated to set me down for a genuine European.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he really met me as he said?&nbsp; I cannot
precisely say; the place he mentioned was one whither men,
half-spies, half-travellers, and whole intriguers from the
interior districts, nay, even from Nedjed itself, not
unfrequently resort; and, as I myself was conscious of having
paid more than one visit there, my officious interlocutor might
very possibly have been one of those present on some such
occasion.&nbsp; So that although I did not now recognize him in
particular, there was a strong intrinsic probability in favor of
his ill-timed veracity; and his thus coming in to support the
first witness in his assertions rendered my predicament, already
unsafe, yet worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ere I could frame an answer or resolve what course
to hold, up came a third, who, by overshooting the mark, put the
game into our hands.&nbsp; He too salaams me as an old friend,
and then, turning to those around, now worked up to a most
extraordinary pitch of amazed curiosity, says, &lsquo;And I also
know him perfectly well; I have often met him at Cairo, where he
lives in great wealth in a large house near the
Kasr-el-&rsquo;Eynee; his name is &rsquo;Abd-es-Saleeb; he is
married, and has a very beautiful daughter, who rides an
expensive horse,&rsquo; etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here at last was a pure invention or mistake (for I
know not which it was) that admitted of a flat denial.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Aslahek Allah,&rsquo; &lsquo;May Heaven set you
right,&rsquo; <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>said I; &lsquo;never did I live at Cairo, nor have I
the blessing of any horse-riding young ladies for
daughters.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then, looking very hard at my second
detector, toward whom I had all the right of doubt, &lsquo;I do
not remember having ever seen you; think well as to what you say;
many a man besides myself has a reddish beard and straw-colored
mustaches,&rsquo; taking pains, however, not to seem particularly
&lsquo;careful to answer him in this matter,&rsquo; but as if
merely questioning the precise identity.&nbsp; But for the first
of the trio I knew not what to do or to reply, so I continued to
look at him with a killing air of inquisitive stupidity, as
though not fully understanding his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Seyf, though himself at first somewhat staggered by
this sudden downpour of recognition, was now reassured by the
discomfiture of the third witness, and came to the convenient
conclusion that the two others were no better worthy of
credit.&nbsp; &lsquo;Never mind them,&rsquo; exclaimed he,
addressing himself to us, &lsquo;they are talkative liars, mere
gossipers; let them alone, they do not deserve attention; come
along with me to the k&rsquo;hawah in the palace, and rest
yourselves.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then turning to my poor Damascene
friend, whose only wrong was to have been overmuch in the right,
he sharply chid him, and next the rest, and led us off, most glad
to follow the leader, through the narrow and dark portal into the
royal residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we remained whilst coffee was, as wont, prepared
and served.&nbsp; Seyf, who had left us awhile, now came back to
say that Telal would soon return <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>from his afternoon walk in a garden
where he had been taking the air, and that if we would pass into
the outer court we should then and there have the opportunity of
paying him our introductory respects.&nbsp; He added that we
should afterward find our supper ready, and be provided also with
good lodgings for the night; finally, that the k&rsquo;hawah and
what it contained were always at our disposition so long as we
should honor Ha&rsquo;yel by our presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We rose accordingly and returned with Seyf to the
outside area.&nbsp; It was fuller than ever, on account of the
expected appearance of the monarch.&nbsp; A few minutes later we
saw a crowd approach from the upper extremity of the place,
namely, that toward the market.&nbsp; When the new-comers drew
near, we saw them to be almost exclusively armed men, with some
of the more important-looking citizens, but all on foot.&nbsp; In
the midst of this circle, though detached from those around them,
slowly advanced three personages, whose dress and deportment,
together with the respectful distance observed by the rest,
announced superior rank.&nbsp; &lsquo;Here comes Telal,&rsquo;
said Seyf, in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The midmost figure was in fact that of the prince
himself.&nbsp; Short of stature, broad-shouldered, and strongly
built, of a very dusky complexion, with long black hair, dark and
piercing eyes, and a countenance rather severe than open, Telal
might readily be supposed above forty years in age, though he is
in fact thirty-seven or thirty-eight at most.&nbsp; His step was
measured, his demeanor grave and somewhat haughty.&nbsp; His
dress, a long robe of cashmere shawl, covered <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>the white
Arab shirt, and over all he wore a delicately worked cloak of
camel&rsquo;s-hair from Oman, a great rarity, and highly valued
in this part of Arabia.&nbsp; His head was adorned by a broidered
handkerchief, in which silk and gold thread had not been spared,
and girt by a broad band of camel&rsquo;s-hair entwined with red
silk, the manufacture of Meshid &rsquo;Alee.&nbsp; A gold-mounted
sword hung by his side, and his dress was perfumed with musk, in
a degree better adapted to Arab than to European nostrils.&nbsp;
His glance never rested for a moment; sometimes it turned on his
nearer companions, sometimes on the crowd; I have seldom seen so
truly an &lsquo;eagle eye,&rsquo; in rapidity and in
brilliancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By his side walked a tall, thin individual, clad in
garments of somewhat less costly material, but of gayer colors
and embroidery than those of the king himself.&nbsp; His face
announced unusual intelligence and courtly politeness; his sword
was not, however, adorned with gold, the exclusive privilege of
the royal family, but with silver only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was Zamil, the treasurer and prime
minister&mdash;sole minister, indeed, of the autocrat.&nbsp;
Raised from beggary by Abdallah, the late king, who had seen in
the ragged orphan signs of rare capacity, he continued to merit
the uninterrupted favor of his patron, and after his death, had
become equally, or yet more, dear to Telal, who raised him from
post to post, till he at last occupied the highest position in
the kingdom after the monarch himself.&nbsp; Of the demurely
smiling Abd-el-Mahsin, the second companion of the king&rsquo;s
evening walk, I will say nothing for the <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>moment; we
shall have him before long for a very intimate acquaintance and a
steady friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone stood up as Telal drew nigh.&nbsp; Seyf gave
us a sign to follow him, made way through the crowd, and saluted
his sovereign with the authorized formula of &lsquo;Peace be with
you, O the Protected of God!&rsquo;&nbsp; Telal at once cast on
us a penetrating glance, and addressed a question in a low voice
to Seyf, whose answer was in the same tone.&nbsp; The prince then
looked again toward us, but with a friendlier expression of
face.&nbsp; We approached and touched his open hand, repeating
the same salutation as that used by Seyf.&nbsp; No bow,
hand-kissing, or other ceremony is customary on these
occasions.&nbsp; Telal returned our greeting, and then, without a
word more to us, whispered a moment to Seyf, and passed on
through the palace gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He will give you a private audience
to-morrow,&rsquo; said Seyf, &lsquo;and I will take care that you
have notice of it in due time; meanwhile come to
supper.&rsquo;&nbsp; The sun had already set when we re-entered
the palace.&nbsp; This time, after passing the arsenal, we turned
aside into a large square court, distinct from the former, and
surrounded by an open veranda, spread with mats.&nbsp; Two large
ostriches, presents offered to Telal by some chiefs of the
Solibah tribe, strutted about the enclosure, and afforded much
amusement to the negro boys and scullions of the
establishment.&nbsp; Seyf conducted us to the further side of the
court, where we seated ourselves under the portico.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hither some black slaves immediately brought the
supper; the &lsquo;pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance&rsquo; was,
as usual, a <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>huge dish of rice and boiled meat, with some thin cakes
of unleavened bread and dates, and small onions with chopped
gourds intermixed.&nbsp; The cookery was better than what we had
heretofore tasted, though it would, perhaps, have hardly passed
muster with a Vatel.&nbsp; We made a hearty meal, took coffee in
the k&rsquo;hawah, and then returned to sit awhile and smoke our
pipes in the open air.&nbsp; Needs not say how lovely are the
summer evenings, how cool the breeze, how pure the sky, in these
mountainous districts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palgrave gives a historical sketch of the rise of Prince Telal
to a position of power and importance in Central Arabia, scarcely
secondary to that of the Wahabee ruler of Nedjed.&nbsp; The
region of Djebel Shomer was subjected to the Wahabee rule during
the last century, and the severe discipline of the new creed was
forced upon its inhabitants.&nbsp; But, after the taking of
Derreyeh by Ibrahim Pasha, the people regained a partial
independence, and a rivalry for the chieftainship ensued between
the two noble houses of Djaaper and Beyt Alee.&nbsp; The leader
of the former was a young man named Abdallah, of more than
ordinary character and intelligence, wealthy and popular.&nbsp;
But he was defeated in the struggle, and about the year 1820 was
driven into exile.</p>
<p>With a small band of followers he reached the Wady Sirhan
(traversed by Palgrave on his way to the Djowf), where they were
attacked by the Aneyzeh Bedouins, all the rest slain, and
Abdallah left for dead on the sands.&nbsp; The Arab story is that
the locusts came around them, scattered the sand with their wings
and feet upon his wounds and thus stopped the <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>flow of
blood, while a flock of partridges hung above him to screen him
from the burning sun.&nbsp; A merchant of Damascus, passing by
with his caravan, beheld the miracle, took the youth, bound up
his wounds, and restored him to health by the most tender
care.&nbsp; When he had recovered his vigor in Damascus, the
generous merchant sent him back to Arabia.</p>
<p>He went first to the Nedjed, entered the service of the
Wahabee chief, rose to high military rank, and finally, by his
own personal bravery, secured the sovereignty to Feysul, the
present (1863) ruler.&nbsp; The latter then gave him an army to
recover his heritage of Djebel Shomer, and about the year 1830
his sway was secured in his native country.&nbsp; The rival clan
of Beyt Alee was extirpated, only one child being left, whom
Telal afterward, with a rare but politic generosity, restored to
wealth and honors.</p>
<p>Abdallah took every means to strengthen his power.&nbsp; He
found it necessary, through his dependence on Feysul, to
establish the Wahabee creed; he used the Bedouins as allies, in
order to repress the rivalry of the nobles, and thus gained power
at the expense of popularity.&nbsp; Many plots were formed
against him, many attempts made to assassinate him, but they all
failed: his lucky star attended him throughout.&nbsp; Up to this
time he had dwelt in a quarter of the capital which the old
chieftains and the nobility had mainly chosen for their domicile,
and where the new monarch was surrounded by men his equals in
birth and of even more ancient title to command.&nbsp; But now he
added a new quarter to the town, and <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>there laid the foundations of a vast
palace destined for the future abode of the king and the display
of all his grandeur, amid streets and nobles of his own
creation.&nbsp; The walls of the projected edifice were fast
rising when he died, almost suddenly, in 1844 or 1845, leaving
three sons&mdash;Telal, Meta&rsquo;ab, and Mohammed&mdash;the
eldest scarce twenty years of age, besides his only surviving
brother Obeyd, who could not then have been much under fifty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telal was already highly popular,&rdquo; says Palgrave,
&ldquo;much more so than his father, and had given early tokens
of those superior qualities which accompanied him to the
throne.&nbsp; All parties united to proclaim him sole heir to the
kingdom and lawful successor to the regal power, and thus the
rival pretensions of Obeyd, hated by many and feared by all, were
smothered at the outset and put aside without a contest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young sovereign possessed, in fact, all that Arab
ideas require to insure good government and lasting
popularity.&nbsp; Affable toward the common people, reserved and
haughty with the aristocracy, courageous and skilful in war, a
lover of commerce and building in time of peace, liberal even to
profusion, yet always careful to maintain and augment the state
revenue, neither over-strict nor yet scandalously lax in
religion, secret in his designs, but never known to break a
promise once given, or violate a plighted faith; severe in
administration, yet averse to bloodshed, he offered the very type
of what an Arab prince should be.&nbsp; I might add, that among
all rulers or governors, European or Asiatic, with whose <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>acquaintance I have ever chanced to be honored, I know
few equal in the true art of government to Telal, son of
Abdallah-ebn-Rasheed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His first cares were directed to adorn and civilize the
capital.&nbsp; Under his orders, enforced by personal
superintendence, the palace commenced by his father was soon
brought to completion.&nbsp; But he added, what probably his
father would hardly have thought of, a long row of warehouses,
the dependencies and property of the same palace; next he built a
market-place consisting of about eighty shops or magazines,
destined for public commerce and trade, and lastly constructed a
large mosque for the official prayers of Friday.&nbsp; Round the
palace, and in many other parts of the town, he opened streets,
dug wells, and laid out extensive gardens, besides strengthening
the old fortifications all round and adding new ones.&nbsp; At
the same time he managed to secure at once the fidelity and the
absence of his dangerous uncle by giving him charge of those
military expeditions which best satisfied the restless energy of
Obeyd.&nbsp; The first of these wars was directed, I know not on
what pretext, against Kheybar.&nbsp; But as Telal intended rather
to enforce submission than to inflict ruin, he associated with
Obeyd in the military command his own brother Meta&rsquo;ab, to
put a check on the ferocity of the former.&nbsp; Kheybar was
conquered, and Telal sent thither, as governor in his name, a
young man of Ha&rsquo;yel, prudent and gentle, whom I
subsequently met when he was on a visit at the capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long after, the inhabitants of Kaseem, weary of
Wahabee tyranny, turned their eyes toward Telal, <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>who had
already given a generous and inviolable asylum to the numerous
political exiles of that district.&nbsp; Secret negotiations took
place, and at a favorable moment the entire uplands of that
province&mdash;after a fashion not indeed peculiar to
Arabia&mdash;annexed themselves to the kingdom of Shomer by
universal and unanimous suffrage.&nbsp; Telal made suitable
apologies to the Nedjean monarch, the original sovereign of the
annexed district; he could not resist the popular wish; it had
been forced on him, etc.&mdash;but Western Europe is familiar
with the style.&nbsp; Feysul felt the inopportuneness of a
quarrel with the rapidly growing power to which he himself had
given origin only a few years before, and, after a wry face or
two, swallowed the pill.&nbsp; Meanwhile Telal knowing the
necessity of a high military reputation, both at home and abroad,
undertook in person a series of operations against Teyma&rsquo;
and its neighborhood, and at last against the Djowf itself.&nbsp;
Everywhere his arms were successful, and his moderation in
victory secured the attachment of the vanquished themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toward his own subjects his conduct is uniformly of a
nature to merit their obedience and attachment, and few
sovereigns have here met with better success.&nbsp; Once a day,
often twice, he gives public audience, hears patiently, and
decides in person, the minutest causes with great good
sense.&nbsp; To the Bedouins, no insignificant portion of his
rule, he makes up for the restraint he imposes, and the tribute
he levies from them, by a profusion of hospitality not to be
found elsewhere in the whole of Arabia from Akabah to Aden.&nbsp;
His guests at the midday <a name="page151"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 151</span>and evening meal are never less than
fifty or sixty, and I have often counted up to two hundred at a
banquet, while presents of dress and arms are of frequent if not
daily occurrence.&nbsp; It is hard for Europeans to estimate how
much popularity such conduct brings an Asiatic prince.&nbsp;
Meanwhile the townsfolk and villagers love him for the more solid
advantages of undisturbed peace at home, of flourishing commerce,
of extended dominion, and military glory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To capital punishment he is decidedly adverse, and the
severest penalty with which he has hitherto chastised political
offences is banishment or prison.&nbsp; Indeed, even in cases of
homicide or murder, he has been known not unfrequently to avail
himself of the option allowed by Arab custom between a fine and
retaliation, and to buy off the offender, by bestowing on the
family of the deceased the allotted price of blood from his own
private treasury, and that from a pure motive of humanity.&nbsp;
When execution does take place, it is always by beheading; nor is
indeed any other mode of putting to death customary in
Arabia.&nbsp; Stripes, however, are not uncommon, though
administered on the broad back, not on the sole of the
foot.&nbsp; They are the common chastisement for minor offences,
like stealing, cursing, or quarrelling; in this last case both
parties usually come in for their share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his numerous retainers he is almost
over-indulgent, and readily pardons a mistake or a negligence;
falsehood alone he never forgives; and it is notorious that
whoever has once lied to Telal must give up all hopes of future
favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>After
describing the public audience which is daily given by this
excellent prince, Palgrave describes the more private reception
which was accorded to himself and his companion:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telal, once free from the mixed crowd, pauses a moment
till we rejoin him.&nbsp; The simple and customary salutations
are given and returned.&nbsp; I then present him with our only
available testimonial, the scrap written by Hamood from the
Djowf.&nbsp; He opens it, and hands it over to Zamil, better
skilled in reading than his master.&nbsp; Then laying aside all
his wonted gravity, and assuming a good-humored smile, he takes
my hand in his right and my companion&rsquo;s in his left, and
thus walks on with us through the court, past the mosque, and
down the market-place, while his attendants form a moving wall
behind and on either side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was in his own mind thoroughly persuaded that we
were, as we appeared, Syrians; but imagined, nor was he entirely
in the wrong thus far, that we had other objects in view than
mere medical practice.&nbsp; But if he was right in so much, he
was less fortunate in the interpretation he chose to put on our
riddle, having imagined that our real scope must be to buy horses
for some government, of which we must be the agents; a conjecture
which had certainly the merit of plausibility.&nbsp; However,
Telal had, I believe, no doubt on the matter, and had already
determined to treat us well in the horse business, and to let us
have a good bargain, as it shortly appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly he began a series of questions and
cross-questions, all in a jocose way, but so that the <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>very drift
of his inquiries soon allowed us to perceive what he really
esteemed us.&nbsp; We, following our previous resolution, stuck
to medicine, a family in want, hopes of good success under the
royal patronage and much of the same tenor.&nbsp; But Telal was
not so easily to be blinkered, and kept to his first
judgment.&nbsp; Meanwhile we passed down the street, lined with
starers at the king and us, and at last arrived at the outer door
of a large house near the farther end of the Sook or
market-place; it belonged to Hasan, the merchant from Meshid
&rsquo;Alee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three of the retinue stationed themselves by way of
guard at the street door, sword in hand.&nbsp; The rest entered
with the king and ourselves; we traversed the court-yard, where
the remainder of the armed men took position, while we went on to
the k&rsquo;hawah.&nbsp; It was small, but well furnished and
carpeted.&nbsp; Here Telal placed us amicably by his side in the
highest place; his brother Mohammed and five or six others were
admitted, and seated themselves each according to his rank, while
Hasan, being master of the house, did the honors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee was brought and pipes lighted.&nbsp; Meantime
Ebn-Rasheed renewed his interrogatory, skilfully throwing out
side remarks, now on the government of Syria, now on that of
Egypt, then on the Bedouins to the north of Djowf, or on the
tribes of Hedjaz, or on the banks of the Euphrates, thus to gain
light whence and to what end we had in fact come.&nbsp; Next he
questioned us on medicine, perhaps to discover whether we had the
right professional tone; then on horses, about which same noble
<a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>animals
we affected an ignorance unnatural and very unpardonable in an
Englishman; but for which I hope afterward to make amends to my
readers.&nbsp; All was in vain; and after a full hour our noble
friend had only managed by his cleverness to get himself farther
off the right track than he had been at the outset.&nbsp; He felt
it, and determined to let matters have their own course, and to
await the result of time.&nbsp; So he ended by assuring us of his
entire confidence and protection, offering us, to boot, a lodging
on the palace grounds.&nbsp; But this we declined, being desirous
of studying the country as it was in itself, not through the
medium of a court atmosphere; so we begged that an abode might be
assigned us as near the market-place as possible; and this he
promised, though evidently rather put out by our independent
ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent water-melons, ready peeled and cut up, with
peaches hardly ripe, for it was the beginning of the season, were
now brought in, and we all partook in common.&nbsp; This was the
signal for breaking up; Telal renewed his proffers of favor and
patronage; and we were at last reconducted to our lodgings by one
of the royal guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seyf now went in search of a permanent dwelling-place
wherein to install us; and, before evening, succeeded in finding
one situated in a street leading at right angles to the market,
and at no unreasonable distance from the palace.&nbsp; Every door
was provided with its own distinct lock; the keys here are made
of iron, and in this respect Ha&rsquo;yel has the better of any
other Arab town it was my chance to visit, where the <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>keys were
invariably wooden, and thus very liable to break and get out of
order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court-yard was soon thronged with visitors, some
from the palace, others from the town.&nbsp; One had a sick
relation, whom he begged us to come and see, another some
personal ailment, a third had called out of mere politeness or
curiosity; in short, men of all conditions and of all ages, but
for the most part open and friendly in manner, so that we could
already anticipate a very speedy acquaintance with the town and
whatever it contained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nature of our occupations now led to a certain
daily routine, though it was often agreeably diversified by
incidental occurrences.&nbsp; Perhaps a leaf taken at random from
my journal, now regularly kept, may serve to set before my
readers a tolerable sample of our ordinary course of life and
society at Ha&rsquo;yel, while it will at the same time give a
more distinct idea of the town and people than we have yet
supplied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it, then, the 10th of August, whose jotted notes I
will put together and fill up the blanks.&nbsp; I might equally
have taken the 9th or the 11th, they are all much the same; but
the day I have chosen looks a little the closer written of the
two, and for that sole reason I prefer giving it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that day, then, in 1862, about a fortnight after our
establishment at Ha&rsquo;yel, and when we were, in consequence,
fully inured to our town existence, Seleem Abou
Mahmood-el-&rsquo;Eys and Barakat-esh-Shamee, that is, my
companion and myself, rose, not from our beds, for we had none,
but from our <a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>roof-spread carpets, and took advantage of the silent
hour of the first faint dawn, while the stars yet kept watch in
the sky over the slumbering inhabitants of Shomer, to leave the
house for a cool and undisturbed walk ere the sun should arise
and man go forth unto his work and to his labor.&nbsp; We locked
the outer door, and then passed into the still twilight gloom
down the cross-street leading to the market-place, which we next
followed up to its farther or southwestern end, where large
folding-gates separate it from the rest of the town.&nbsp; The
wolfish city-dogs, whose bark and bite, too, render walking the
streets at night a rather precarious business, now tamely stalked
away in the gloaming, while here and there a crouching camel, the
packages yet on his back, and his sleeping driver close by,
awaited the opening of the warehouse at whose door they had
passed the night.&nbsp; Early though it was, the market gates
were already unclosed, and the guardian sat wakeful in his
niche.&nbsp; On leaving the market we had yet to go down a broad
street of houses and gardens cheerfully intermixed, till at last
we reached the western wall of the town, or, rather, of the new
quarter added by &rsquo;Abdallah, where the high portal between
round flanking towers gave us issue on the open plain, blown over
at this hour by a light gale of life and coolness.&nbsp; To the
west, but some four or five miles distant, rose the serrated mass
of Djebel Shomer, throwing up its black fantastic peaks, now
reddened by the reflected dawn, against the lead-blue sky.&nbsp;
Northward the same chain bends round till it meets the town, and
then stretches away for a length of ten or twelve <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>days&rsquo;
journey, gradually losing in height on its approach to Meshid
&rsquo;Alee and the valley of the Euphrates.&nbsp; On our south
we have a little isolated knot of rocks, and far off the extreme
ranges of Djebel Shomer, or &rsquo;Aja, to give it its historical
name, intersected by the broad passes that lead on in the same
direction to Djebel Solma.&nbsp; Behind us lies the
capital.&nbsp; Telal&rsquo;s palace, with its high oval keep,
houses, gardens, walls, and towers, all coming out black against
the ruddy bars of eastern light, and behind, a huge pyramidal
peak almost overhanging the town, and connected by lower rocks
with the main mountain range to north and south, those stony ribs
that protect the central heart of the kingdom.&nbsp; In the plain
itself we can just distinguish by the doubtful twilight several
blackish patches irregularly scattered over its face, or seen as
though leaning upward against its craggy verge; these are the
gardens and country houses of &rsquo;Obeyd and other chiefs,
besides hamlets and villages, such as Kefar and &rsquo;Adwah,
with their groves of palm and &lsquo;ithel&rsquo; (the Arab
larch), now blended in the dusk.&nbsp; One solitary traveller on
his camel, a troop of jackals sneaking off to their rocky cavern,
a few dingy tents of Shomer Bedouins, such are the last details
of the landscape.&nbsp; Far away over the southern hills beams
the glory of Canopus, and announces a new Arab year; the
pole-star to the north lies low over the mountain tops.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We pace the pebble-strown flat to the south till we
leave behind us the length of the town wall, and reach the little
cluster of rocks already mentioned.&nbsp; We scramble up to a
sort of niche near its summit, <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>whence, at a height of a hundred
feet or more, we can overlook the whole extent of the plain and
wait the sunrise.&nbsp; Yet before the highest crags of Shomer
are gilt with its first rays, or the long giant shadows of the
easterly chain have crossed the level, we see groups of peasants,
who, driving their fruit and vegetable-laden asses before them,
issue like little bands of ants from the mountain gorges around,
and slowly approach on the tracks converging to the
capital.&nbsp; Horsemen from the town ride out to the gardens,
and a long line of camels on the westerly Medina road winds up
toward Ha&rsquo;yel.&nbsp; We wait ensconced in our rocky lookout
and enjoy the view till the sun has risen, and the coolness of
the night air warms rapidly into the sultry day; it is time to
return.&nbsp; So we quit our solitary perch and descend to the
plain, where, keeping in the shadow of the western
fortifications, we regain the town gate and thence the
market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There all is now life and movement; some of the
warehouses, filled with rice, flour, spices, or coffee, and often
concealing in their inner recesses stores of the prohibited
American weed, are already open; we salute the owners while we
pass, and they return a polite and friendly greeting.&nbsp;
Camels are unloading in the streets, and Bedouins standing by,
looking anything but at home in the town.&nbsp; The shoemaker and
the blacksmith, those two main props of Arab handicraft, are
already at their work, and some gossiping bystanders are
collected around them.&nbsp; At the corner where our cross-street
falls into the market-place, three or four country women are <a
name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>seated,
with piles of melons, gourds, egg-plant fruits, and the other
garden produce before them for sale.&nbsp; My companion falls a
haggling with one of these village nymphs, and ends by obtaining
a dozen &lsquo;badinjans&rsquo; and a couple of water-melons,
each bigger than a man&rsquo;s head, for the equivalent of an
English twopence.&nbsp; With this purchase we return home, where
we shut and bolt the outer door, then take out of a flat basket
what has remained from over night of our wafer-like Ha&rsquo;yel
bread, and with this and a melon make a hasty breakfast.&nbsp; I
say a hasty one, for although it is only half an hour after
sunrise, repeated knocks at our portal show the arrival of
patients and visitors: early rising being here the fashion, and
in reason must be wherever artificial lighting is scanty.&nbsp;
However, we do not at once open to our friends, nor will they
take offence at the delay, but remain where they are, chatting
together before our door till we admit them; of so little value
is time here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In comes a young man of good appearance, clad in the
black cloak common to all of the middle or upper classes in
Central Arabia; in his hand he bears a wand of the Sidr or
lotos-wood.&nbsp; A silver-hilted sword and a glistening
Kafee&rsquo;yah announce him to be a person of some importance,
while his long, black ringlets, handsome features, and slightly
olive complexion, with a tall stature and easy gait, declare him
a native of Djebel Shomer, and townsman of Ha&rsquo;yel; it is
&rsquo;Ojeyl, the eldest-born of a large family, and successor to
the comfortable house and garden of his father, not long since
deceased, in a <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>quarter of the town some twenty minutes&rsquo; walk
distant.&nbsp; He leads by the hand his younger brother, a
modest-looking lad of fair complexion and slim make, but almost
blind, and evidently out of health also.&nbsp; After passing
through the preliminary ceremonies of introduction to Barakat, he
approaches my recess, and standing without, salutes me with the
greatest deference.&nbsp; Thinking him a desirable acquaintance I
receive him very graciously, and he begs me to see what is the
matter with his brother.&nbsp; I examine the case, finding it to
be within the limits of my skill, and not likely to require more
than a very simple course of treatment.&nbsp; Accordingly I make
my bargain for the chances of recovery, and find &rsquo;Ojeyl
docile to the terms proposed, and with little disposition, all
things considered, to backwardness in payment.&nbsp; Arabs,
indeed, are in general close in driving a bargain and open in
downright giving; they will chaffer half a day about a penny,
while they will throw away the worth of pounds on the first
asker.&nbsp; But &rsquo;Ojeyl was one of the best specimens of
the Ha&rsquo;yel character, and of the clan Ta&rsquo;i, renowned
in all times for their liberal ways and high sense of
honor.&nbsp; I next proceed to administer to my patient such
drugs as his state requires, and he receives them with that air
of absolute and half-religious confidence which well-educated
Arabs show to their physician, whom they regard as possessed of
an almost sacred and supernatural power&mdash;a feeling, by the
way, hardly less advantageous to the patient than to the
practitioner, and which may often contribute much to the success
of the treatment.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;During the rest of my stay at Ha&rsquo;yel,
&rsquo;Ojeyl continued to be one of my best friends, I had almost
said disciples; our mutual visits were frequent, and always
pleasing and hearty.&nbsp; His brother&rsquo;s cure, which
followed in less than a fortnight, confirmed his attachment, nor
had I reason to complain of scantiness in his retribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile the court-yard has become full of
visitors.&nbsp; Close by my door I see the intelligent and
demurely smiling face of &rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin, where he sits
between two pretty and well-dressed boys; they are the two elder
children of Telal&mdash;Bedr and Bander.&nbsp; Their guardsman, a
negro slave with a handsome cloak and sword, is seated a little
lower down; farther on are two townsmen, one armed, the other
with a wand at his side.&nbsp; A rough, good-natured youth, of a
bronzed complexion, and whose dingy clothes bespeak his
mechanical profession, is talking with another of a dress
somewhat different in form and coarser in material than that
usually worn in Ha&rsquo;yel; this latter must be a peasant from
some one of the mountain villages.&nbsp; Two Bedouins, ragged and
uncouth, have straggled in with the rest; while a tall,
dark-featured youth, with a gilded hilt to his sword, and more
silk about him than a Wahabee would approve, has taken his place
opposite to &rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin, and is trying to draw him into
conversation.&nbsp; But this last has asked Barakat to lend him
one of my Arabic books to read, and is deeply engaged in its
perusal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ojeyl has taken leave, and I give the next turn
of course to &rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin.&nbsp; He informs me that Telal
has sent me his two sons, Bedr and Bander, that <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>I may
examine their state of health, and see if they require
doctoring.&nbsp; This is in truth a little stroke of policy on
Telal&rsquo;s part, who knows equally with myself that the boys
are perfectly well and want nothing at all.&nbsp; But he wishes
to give us a mark of his confidence, and at the same time to help
us in establishing our medical reputation in the town; for though
by no means himself persuaded of the reality of our doctoral
title, he understands the expediency of saving appearances before
the public.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the children are passed in review with all the
seriousness due to a case of heart complaint or brain fever,
while at a wink from me Barakat prepares in the kitchen a draught
of cinnamon water, which, with sugar, named medicine for the
occasion, pleases the young heirs of royalty and keeps up the
farce; &rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin expatiating all the time to the
bystanders on the wonderful skill with which I have at once
discovered the ailments and their cure, and the small boys
thinking that if this be medicine they will do their best to be
ill for it every day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin now commits them to the negro,
who, however, before taking them back to the palace, has his own
story to tell of some personal ache, for which I prescribe
without stipulating for payment, since he belongs to the palace,
where it is important to have the greatest number of friends
possible, even on the back stairs.&nbsp; But &rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin
remains, reading, chatting, quoting poetry, and talking history,
recent events, natural philosophy, or medicine, as the case may
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us now see some of the other patients.&nbsp; The <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>gold-hilted
swordsman has naturally a special claim on our attention.&nbsp;
He is the son of Rosheyd, Telal&rsquo;s maternal uncle.&nbsp; His
palace stands on the other side of the way, exactly opposite to
our house; and I will say nothing more of him for the present,
intending to pay him afterward a special visit, and thus become
more thoroughly acquainted with the whole family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next let us take notice of those two townsmen who are
conversing, or rather &lsquo;chaffing,&rsquo; together.&nbsp;
Though both in plain apparel, and much alike in stature and
features, there is yet much about them to distinguish the two;
one has a civilian look, the other a military.&nbsp; He of the
wand is no less a personage than Mohammed-el-Kadee, chief justice
of Ha&rsquo;yel, and of course a very important individual in the
town.&nbsp; However, his exterior is that of an elderly,
unpretentious, little man, and one, in spite of the proverb which
attributes gravity to judges, very fond of a joke, besides being
a tolerable representative of what may here be called the
moderate party, neither participating in the fanaticism of the
Wahabee, nor yet, like the most of the indigenous chiefs, hostile
to Mahometanism; he takes his cue from the court direction and is
popular with all factions because belonging properly to none.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He requires some medical treatment for himself, and
more for his son, a big, heavy lad with a swollen arm, who has
accompanied him hither.&nbsp; Here, too, is a useful
acquaintance, well up to all the scandal and small talk of the
town, and willing to communicate it.&nbsp; Our visits were
frequent, and I found his house <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>well stored with books, partly
manuscript, partly printed in Egypt, and mainly on legal or
religious subjects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the country folks in the villages around, like
Mogah, Delhemee&rsquo;eh, and the rest, Mohammed-el-Kadee used to
speak with a sort of half-contemptuous pity, much like a Parisian
talking of Low Bretons; in fact, the difference between these
rough and sturdy boors and the more refined inhabitants of the
capital is, all due proportion allowed, no less remarkable here
than in Europe itself.&nbsp; We will now let one of them come
forward in his own behalf, and my readers shall be judges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is accordingly a stout clown from Mogah, scantily
dressed in working wear, and who has been occupied for the last
half hour in tracing sundry diagrams on the ground before him
with a thick peach-tree switch, thus to pass his time till his
betters shall have been served.&nbsp; He now edges forward, and
taking his seat in front of the door, calls my attention with an
&lsquo;I say, doctor.&rsquo;&nbsp; Whereon I suggest to him that
his bulky corporation not being formed of glass or any other
transparent material, he has by his position entirely intercepted
whatever little light my recess might enjoy.&nbsp; He apologizes,
and shuffles an inch or two sideways.&nbsp; Next I inquire what
ails him, not without some curiosity to hear the answer, so
little does the herculean frame before me announce disease.&nbsp;
Whereto Do&rsquo;eymis, or whatever may be his name, replies,
&lsquo;I say, I am all made up of pain.&rsquo;&nbsp; This
statement, like many others, appears to me rather too general to
be exactly true.&nbsp; So I proceed <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>in my interrogatory: &lsquo;Does
your head pain you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; (I might
have guessed that; these fellows never feel what our
cross-Channel friends entitle &lsquo;<i>le mal des beaux
esprits</i>.&rsquo;)&nbsp; &lsquo;Does your back
ache?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
arms?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
legs?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
body?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; I
conclude, &lsquo;if neither your head nor your body, back, arms,
or legs pain you, how can you possibly be such a composition of
suffering?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am all made up of pain,
doctor,&rsquo; replies he, manfully intrenching himself within
his first position.&nbsp; The fact is, that there is really
something wrong with him, but he does not know how to localize
his sensations.&nbsp; So I push forward my inquiries, till it
appears that our man of Mogah has a chronic rheumatism; and on
ulterior investigation, conducted with all the skill that Barakat
and I can jointly muster, it comes out that three or four months
before he had an attack of the disease in its acute form,
accompanied by high fever, since which he has never been himself
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This might suffice for the diagnosis, but I wish to see
how he will find his way out of more intricate questions;
besides, the townsmen sitting by, and equally alive to the joke
with myself, whisper, &lsquo;Try him again.&rsquo;&nbsp; In
consequence, I proceed with, &lsquo;What was the cause of your
first illness?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I say, doctor, its cause was
God,&rsquo; replies the patient.&nbsp; &lsquo;No doubt of
that,&rsquo; say I; &lsquo;all things are caused by God: but what
was the particular and immediate occasion?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Doctor, its cause was God, and secondly, that I ate
camel&rsquo;s flesh when I was cold,&rsquo; rejoins my scientific
friend.&nbsp; &lsquo;But was there nothing else?&rsquo; I
suggest, <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>not quite satisfied with the lucid explanation just
given.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then, too, I drank camel&rsquo;s milk; but it
was all, I say, from God, doctor,&rsquo; answers he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I consider the case, and make up my mind
regarding the treatment.&nbsp; Next comes the grand question of
payment, which must be agreed on beforehand, and rendered
conditional on success; else no fees for the doctor, not at
Ha&rsquo;yel only, but throughout Arabia.&nbsp; I inquire what he
will give me on recovery.&nbsp; &lsquo;Doctor,&rsquo; answers the
peasant, &lsquo;I will give you, do you hear?&nbsp; I say, I will
give you a camel.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I reply that I do not want
one.&nbsp; &lsquo;I say, remember God,&rsquo; which being
interpreted here means, &lsquo;do not be unreasonable; I will
give you a fat camel, everyone knows my camel; if you choose, I
will bring witnesses, I say.&rsquo;&nbsp; And while I persist in
refusing the proffered camel, he talks of butter, meal, dates,
and such like equivalents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a patient and a paymaster for you.&nbsp;
However, all ends by his behaving reasonably enough; he follows
my prescriptions with the ordinary docility, gets better, and
gives me for my pains an eighteen-penny fee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this residence in Ha&rsquo;yel, Palgrave made many
friends, and soon established those relations of familiar
intercourse which are so much easier in Moslem than in Christian
lands&mdash;a natural result of the preservation of the old
importance, which in the earliest Hebrew days was attached to
&ldquo;the stranger.&rdquo;&nbsp; Palgrave&rsquo;s intimacies
embraced many families related to Telal, and others, whose
knowledge of Arabian history or literature made their
acquaintance <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>welcome.&nbsp; His own knowledge of these subjects,
fortunately, was equal to theirs, and, from the number of his
invitations to dinners and suppers, he seems to have been a
welcome guest to the better classes of Ha&rsquo;yel.&nbsp; One of
the aristocracy, by name Dohey, was his most agreeable
acquaintance; and we quote the following pleasant account of his
intercourse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dohey&rsquo;s invitations were particularly welcome,
both from the pleasantness of his dwelling-place, and from the
varied and interesting conversation that I was sure to meet with
there.&nbsp; This merchant, a tall and stately man of between
fifty and sixty years of age, and whose thin features were
lighted up by a lustre of more than ordinary intelligence, was a
thorough Ha&rsquo;yelite of the old caste, hating Wahabees from
the bottom of his heart, eager for information on cause and
effect, on lands and governments, and holding commerce and social
life for the main props if not the ends of civil and national
organization.&nbsp; His uncle, now near eighty years old, to
judge by conjecture in a land where registers are not much in
use, had journeyed to India, and traded at Bombay; in token
whereof he still wore an Indian skullcap and a cashmere
shawl.&nbsp; The rest of the family were in keeping with the
elder members, and seldom have I seen more dutiful children or a
better educated household.&nbsp; My readers will naturally
understand that by education I here imply its moral not its
intellectual phase.&nbsp; The eldest son, himself a middle-aged
man, would never venture into his father&rsquo;s presence without
unbuckling his sword and leaving it in <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the
vestibule, nor on any account presume to sit on a level with him
or by his side in the divan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The divan itself was one of the prettiest I met with in
these parts.&nbsp; It was a large square room, looking out on the
large house-garden, and cheerfully lighted up by trellised
windows on two sides, while the wall of the third had purposely
been discontinued at about half its height, and the open space
thus left between it and the roof propped by pillars, between
which &lsquo;a fruitful vine by the sides of the house&rsquo; was
intertwined so as to fill up the interval with a gay net-work of
green leaves and tendrils, transparent like stained glass in the
eastern sunbeams.&nbsp; Facing this cheerful light, the floor of
the apartment was raised about two feet above the rest, and
covered with gay Persian carpets, silk cushions, and the best of
Arab furniture.&nbsp; In the lower half of the k&rsquo;hawah, and
at its farthest angle, was the small stone coffee-stove, placed
at a distance where its heat might not annoy the master and his
guests.&nbsp; Many of the city nobility would here resort, and
the talk generally turned on serious subjects, and above all on
the parties and politics of Arabia; while Dohey would show
himself a thorough Arab patriot, and at the same time a courteous
and indulgent judge of foreigners, qualities seldom to be met
with together in any notable degree, and therefore more
welcome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a pleasant hour have I passed in this half
greenhouse, half k&rsquo;hawah, mid cheerful faces and varied
talk, while inly commenting on the natural resources of this
manly and vigorous people, and <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>straining the eye of forethought to
discern through the misty curtain of the future by what outlet
their now unfruitful, because solitary, good may be brought into
fertilizing contact with that of other more advanced nations, to
the mutual benefit of each and all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talk went on with the ease and decorum characteristic
of good Eastern society, without the flippancy and excitement
which occasionally mars it in some countries, no less than
over-silence does in others.&nbsp; To my mind the Easterns are
generally superior in the science of conversation to the
inhabitants of the West; perhaps from a greater necessity of
cultivating it, as the only means of general news and intercourse
where newspapers and pamphlets are unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or else some garden was the scene of our afternoon
leisure, among fruit-trees and palms, by the side of a
watercourse, whose constant supply from the well hid from view
among thick foliage, seemed the work not of laborious art, but of
unassisted nature.&nbsp; Here, stretched in the cool and welcome
shade, would we for hours canvass with &rsquo;Abd-el-Mahsin, and
others of similar pursuits, the respective merits of Arab poets
and authors, of Omar-ebn-el-Farid or Aboo&rsquo;l &rsquo;Ola, in
meetings that had something of the Attic, yet with just enough of
the Arab to render them more acceptable by their Semitic
character of grave cheerfulness and mirthful composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or when the stars came out, Barakat and myself would
stroll out of the heated air of the streets <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>and market
to the cool open plain, and there pass an hour or two alone, or
in conversation with what chance passer-by might steal on us,
half-unperceived and unperceiving in the dusk, and amuse
ourselves with his simplicity if he were a Bedouin, or with his
shrewdness if a townsman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus passed our ordinary life at Ha&rsquo;yel.&nbsp;
Many minor incidents occurred to diversify it, many of the little
ups and downs that human intercourse never fails to furnish;
sometimes the number of patients and the urgency of their
attendance allowed of little leisure for aught except our
professional duties; sometimes a day or two would pass with
hardly any serious occupation.&nbsp; But of such incidents my
readers have a sufficient sample in what has been already set
down.&nbsp; Suffice to say, that from the 27th of July to the 8th
of September we remained doctoring in the capital or in its
immediate neighborhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Palgrave had obtained sufficient knowledge of the
country, and was anxious to advance farther eastward before the
autumn&mdash;the best season for travel&mdash;should be
spent.&nbsp; Now, the journey across the Shomer frontier could
only be pursued with Telal&rsquo;s cognizance, and by his good
will.&nbsp; In fact, a passport bearing the royal signature is
indispensable for all who desire to cross the boundary,
especially into the Wahabee territory; without such a document in
hand no one would venture to conduct them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we requested and
obtained a special audience at the palace.&nbsp; Telal, of <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>whose
good-will we had received frequent, indeed daily, proofs during
our sojourn at Ha&rsquo;yel, proved a sincere friend&mdash;patron
would be a juster word&mdash;to the last; exemplifying the Scotch
proverb about the guest not only who &lsquo;will stay,&rsquo; but
also who &lsquo;maun gang.&rsquo;&nbsp; To this end he then
dictated to Zamil, for Telal himself is no scribe, a passport or
general letter of safe conduct, enough to insure us good
treatment within the limits of his rule, and even beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this was written, Telal affixed his seal, and rose
to leave us alone with Zamil, after a parting shake of the hand,
and wishing us a prosperous journey and speedy return.&nbsp; Yet
with all these motives for going, I could not but feel reluctant
to quit a pleasing town, where we certainly possessed many
sincere friends and well-wishers, for countries in which we could
by no means anticipate equal favor, or even equal safety.&nbsp;
Indeed, so ominous was all that we heard about Wahabee Nedjed, so
black did the landscape before us look, on nearer approach, that
I almost repented of my resolution, and was considerably inclined
to say, &lsquo;Thus far enough, and no farther.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Obeyd, Telal&rsquo;s uncle, had left
Ha&rsquo;yel the day before on a military expedition against the
Bedouins of the West.&nbsp; In common with all the sight-seers of
the town, we had gone to witness his departure.&nbsp; It was a
gay and interesting scene.&nbsp; &rsquo;Obeyd had caused his tent
to be pitched in the plain without the northern walls, and there
reviewed his forces.&nbsp; About one-third were on horseback, the
rest were mounted <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>on light and speedy camels; all had spears and
matchlocks, to which the gentry added swords; and while they rode
hither and thither in sham man&oelig;uvres over the parade
ground, the whole appearance was very picturesque and tolerably
martial.&nbsp; &rsquo;Obeyd now unfurled his own peculiar
standard, in which the green color, distinctive of Islam, had
been added border-wise to the white ground of the ancestral
Nedjean banner, mentioned fourteen centuries back by
&rsquo;Omar-ebn-Kelthoom, the poet of Taghleb, and many
others.&nbsp; Barakat and myself mixed with the crowd of
spectators.&nbsp; &rsquo;Obeyd saw us, and it was now several
days since we had last met.&nbsp; Without hesitating he cantered
up to us, and while he tendered his hand for a farewell shake, he
said: &lsquo;I have heard that you intend going to Ri&rsquo;ad;
there you will meet with &rsquo;Abdallah, the eldest son of
Feysul; he is my particular friend; I should much desire to see
you high in his good graces, and to that end I have written him a
letter in your behalf, of which you yourselves are to be the
bearers; you will find it in my house, where I have left it for
you with one of my servants.&rsquo;&nbsp; He then assured us that
if he found us still at Ha&rsquo;yel on his return, he would
continue to befriend us in every way; but that if we journeyed
forward to Nedjed, we should meet with a sincere friend in
&rsquo;Abdallah, especially if we gave him the letter in
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He then took his leave with a semblance of affectionate
cordiality that made the bystanders stare; thus supporting to the
last the profound dissimulation which he had only once belied for
a moment.&nbsp; <a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>The letter was duly handed over to us the same
afternoon by his head steward, whom he had left to look after the
house and garden in his absence.&nbsp; Doubtless my readers will
be curious to know what sort of recommendation &rsquo;Obeyd had
provided us with.&nbsp; It was written on a small scrap of thick
paper, about four inches each way, carefully folded up and
secured by three seals.&nbsp; However, &lsquo;our fears
forgetting manners,&rsquo; we thought best with Hamlet to make
perusal of this grand commission before delivering it to its
destination.&nbsp; So we undid the seals with precautions
admitting of reclosing them in proper form, and read the royal
knavery.&nbsp; I give it word for word; it ran thus: &lsquo;In
the name of God the Merciful, the Compassionate, we,
&rsquo;Obeyd-ebn-Rasheed, salute you, O &rsquo;Abdallah, son of
Feysul-ebn-Sa&rsquo;ood, and peace be on you, and the mercy of
God and His blessings.&rsquo;&nbsp; (This is the invariable
commencement of all Wahabee epistles, to the entire omission of
the complimentary formulas used by other Orientals.)&nbsp;
&lsquo;After which,&rsquo; so proceeded the document, &lsquo;we
inform you that the bearers of this are one Seleem-el-&rsquo;Eys,
and his comrade, Barakat-esh-Shamee, who give themselves out for
having some knowledge in&rsquo;&mdash;here followed a word of
equivocal import, capable of interpretation alike by
&lsquo;medicine&rsquo; or &lsquo;magic,&rsquo; but generally used
in Nedjed for the latter, which is at Ri&rsquo;ad a capital
crime.&nbsp; &lsquo;Now may God forbid that we should hear of any
evil having befallen you.&nbsp; We salute also your father,
Feysul, and your brothers, and all your family, and anxiously
await your news in answer.&nbsp; Peace be with you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Here followed the signet impression.</p>
<p><a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>&ldquo;A pretty recommendation, especially under the
actual circumstances!&nbsp; However, not content with this,
&rsquo;Obeyd found means to transmit further information
regarding us, and all in the same tenor, to Ri&rsquo;ad, as we
afterward discovered.&nbsp; For his letter, I need hardly say
that it never passed from our possession, where it yet remains as
an interesting autograph, to that of &rsquo;Abdallah; with whom
it would inevitably have proved the one only thing wanting, as we
shall subsequently see, to make us leave the forfeit of our lives
in the Nedjean man-trap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before evening three men knocked at our door; they were
our future guides.&nbsp; The eldest bore the name of Mubarek, and
was a native of the suburbs of Bereydah; all three were of the
genuine Kaseem breed, darker and lower in stature than the
inhabitants of Ha&rsquo;yel, but not ill-looking, and extremely
affable in their demeanor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had soon made all necessary arrangements for our
departure, got in a few scattered debts, packed up our
pharmacopoeia, and nothing now remained but the pleasurable pain
of farewells.&nbsp; They were many and mutually sincere.&nbsp;
Meta&rsquo;ab had indeed made his a few days before, when he a
second time left Ha&rsquo;yel for the pastures; Telal we had
already taken leave of, but there remained his younger brother
Mohammed to give us a hearty adieu of good augury.&nbsp; Most of
my old acquaintance or patients, Dohey the merchant, Mohammed the
judge, Doheym and his family, not forgetting our earliest friend
Seyf the chamberlain, Sa&rsquo;eed, the cavalry officer, and
others of the court, freemen and slaves, white or black (for <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>negroes
readily follow the direction indicated by their masters, and are
not ungrateful if kindly treated, while kept in their due
position), and many others of whose names Homer would have made a
catalogue and I will not, heard of our near departure and came to
express their regrets, with hopes of future meeting and
return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early next morning, before day, Mubarek and another of
his countrymen, named Dahesh, were at our door with the
camels.&nbsp; Some of our town friends had also come, even at
this hour, to accompany us as far as the city gates.&nbsp; We
mounted our beasts, and while the first sunbeams streamed level
over the plain, passed through the southwestern portal beyond the
market-place, the 8th of September, 1862, and left the city of
Ha&rsquo;yel.&rdquo;</p>

176</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Journey to Bereydah</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Another</span> stage of our way.&nbsp;
From Gaza to Ma&rsquo;an, from Ma&rsquo;an to the Djowf, from the
Djowf to Ha&rsquo;yel, three such had now been gone over, not
indeed without some fatigue or discomfort, yet at comparatively
little personal risk, except what nature herself, not man, might
occasion.&nbsp; For to cross the stony desert of the northern
frontier, or the sandy Nefood in the very height of summer, could
not be said to be entirely free from danger, where in these
waterless wastes thirst, if nothing else, may alone, and often
does, suffice to cause the disappearance of the over-venturous
traveller, nay, even of many a Bedouin, no less effectually than
a lance-thrust or a musket-ball.&nbsp; But if nature had been so
far unkind, of man at least we had hitherto not much to complain;
the Bedouins on the route, however rough and uncouth in their
ways, had, with only one exception, meant us fairly well, and the
townsmen in general had proved friendly and courteous beyond our
expectation.&nbsp; Once within the established government limits
of Telal, and among his subjects, we had enjoyed our share in the
common security afforded to wayfarers and inhabitants for life
and property, while good success had hitherto accompanied
us.&nbsp; <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>&lsquo;Judge of the day by its dawn,&rsquo; say the
Arabs; and although this proverb, like all proverbs, does not
always hold exactly true, whether for sunshine or cloud, yet it
has its value at times.&nbsp; And thus, whatever unfavorable
predictions or dark forebodings our friends might hint regarding
the inner Nedjed and its denizens, we trusted that so favorable a
past augured somewhat better things for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From physical and material difficulties like those
before met with, there was henceforward much less to fear.&nbsp;
The great heats of summer were past, the cooler season had set
in; besides, our path now lay through the elevated table-land of
Central Arabia, whose northern rim we had already surmounted at
our entrance on the Djebel Shomer.&nbsp; Nor did there remain any
uncultivated or sandy track to cross comparable to the Nefood of
Djowf between Ha&rsquo;yel and Ri&rsquo;ad; on the contrary, we
were to expect pasture lands and culture, villages and
habitations, cool mountain air, and a sufficiency, if not an
abundance, of water.&nbsp; Nor were our fellow-companions now
mere Bedouins and savages, but men from town or village life,
members of organized society, and so far civilized beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When adieus, lookings back, wavings of the hand, and
all the customary signs of farewell and good omen were over
between our Ha&rsquo;yel friends and ourselves, we pursued our
road by the plain which I have already described as having been
the frequent scene of our morning walks; but instead of following
the southwesterly path toward Kefar, whose groves and roof-tops
now rose in a blended mass before us, <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>we turned eastward, and rounded,
though at some distance, the outer wall of Ha&rsquo;yel for
nearly half an hour, till we struck off by a southeasterly track
across stony ground, diversified here and there by wells, each
with a cluster of gardens and a few houses in its
neighborhood.&nbsp; At last we reached a narrow winding pass
among the cliffs of Djebel &rsquo;Aja&rsquo;, whose mid-loop
encircles Ha&rsquo;yel on all sides, and here turned our heads to
take a last far-off view of what had been our home, or the
agreeable semblance of a home, for several weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our only companions as yet were Mubarek and
Dahesh.&nbsp; We had outstripped the rest, whose baggage and
equipments had required a more tedious arrangement than our
own.&nbsp; Before long they came up&mdash;a motley crew.&nbsp;
Ten or thereabouts of the Kaseem, some from Bereydah itself,
others from neighboring towns; two individuals, who gave
themselves out, but with more asseveration than truth, to be
natives of Mecca itself; three Bedouins, two of whom belonged to
the Shomer clan, the third an &rsquo;Anezah of the north; next a
runaway negro, conducting four horses, destined to pass the whole
breadth of Arabia, and to be shipped off at Koweyt, on the
Persian Gulf, for Indian sale; two merchants, one from Zulphah,
in the province of Sedeyr, the other from Zobeyr, near Bussora;
lastly, two women, wives of I know not exactly whom in the
caravan, with some small children; all this making up, ourselves
included, a band of twenty-seven or twenty-eight persons, the
most mounted on camels, a few on horseback, and accompanied by a
few beasts of <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>burden alongside&mdash;such was our Canterbury
pilgrims&rsquo; group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus assembled, on we went together, now amid granite
rocks, now crossing grassy valleys, till near sunset we stopped
under a high cliff, at the extreme southerly verge of Djebel
&rsquo;Aja&rsquo;, or, in modern parlance, of Djebel
Shomer.&nbsp; The mountain here extended far away to right and
left, but in front a wide plain of full twenty miles across
opened out before us, till bounded southward by the long bluish
chain of Djebel Solma, whose line runs parallel to the heights we
were now to leave, and belongs to the same formation and rocky
mass denominated in a comprehensive way the mountains of
Ta&rsquo;i or Shomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At about three in the afternoon, next day, we saw, some
way off to our west, a troop of Bedouins coming up from the
direction of Medina.&nbsp; While they were yet in the distance,
and half-hidden from view by the shrubs and stunted acacias of
the plain, we could not precisely distinguish their numbers; but
they were evidently enough to make us desire, with Orlando,
&lsquo;that we might be better strangers.&rsquo;&nbsp; On our
side we mustered about fifteen matchlocks, besides a few spears
and swords.&nbsp; The Bedouins had already perceived us, and
continued to approach, though in the desultory and circuitous way
which they affect when doubtful of the strength of their
opponent; still they gained on us more than was pleasant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen armed townsmen might stand for a reasonable
match against double the number of Bedouins, and in any case we
had certainly nothing better <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>to do than to put a bold face on the
matter.&nbsp; The &rsquo;Eyoon chief, Foleyh, with two of his
countrymen and Ghashee, carefully primed their guns, and then set
off at full gallop to meet the advancing enemy, brandishing their
weapons over their heads, and looking extremely fierce.&nbsp;
Under cover of this man&oelig;uvre the rest of our band set about
getting their arms ready, and an amusing scene ensued.&nbsp; One
had lost his match, and was hunting for it in his housings;
another, in his haste to ram the bullet home had it stick midway
in the barrel, and could neither get it up nor down; the lock of
a third was rusty and would not do duty; the women began to whine
piteously; the two Meccans, who for economy&rsquo;s sake were
both riding one only camel, a circumstance which caused between
them many international squabbles, tried to make their beast
gallop off with them, and leave the others to their fate; while
the more courageous animal, despising such cowardly measures,
insisted on remaining with his companions and sharing their lot;
all was thoroughly Arab, much hubbub and little done.&nbsp; Had
the menacing feint of the four who protected our rear proved
insufficient, we might all have been in a very bad predicament,
and this feeling drew every face with reverted gaze in a backward
direction.&nbsp; But the Harb banditti, intimidated by the bold
countenance of Foleyh and his companions, wheeled about and
commenced a skirmishing retreat, in which a few shots, guiltless
of bloodshed, were fired for form&rsquo;s sake on either side,
till at last our assailants fairly disappeared in the remote
valley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our valiant champions now returned from <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>pursuit,
much elated with their success, and we journeyed on together,
skirting the last rocky spur of Solma, close by the spot where
Hatim Ta&rsquo;i, the well-known model, half mythic and half
historical, of Arab hospitality and exaggerated generosity, is
said to be buried.&nbsp; Here we crossed some low hills that form
a sort of offshoot to the Solma mountain, and limit the valley;
and the last rays of the setting sun gilding to our view, in a
sandy bottom some way off, the palm-trees of Feyd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feyd may be taken as a tolerable sample of the villages
met with throughout Northern or Upper Kaseem, for they all bear a
close likeness in their main features, though various in
size.&nbsp; Imagine a little sandy hillock of about sixty or
seventy feet high, in the midst of a wide and dusty valley; part
of the eminence itself and the adjoining bottom is covered by low
earth-built houses, intermixed with groups of the feathery
ithel.&nbsp; The grounds in the neighborhood are divided by brick
walls into green gardens, where gourds and melons, leguminous
plants and maize, grow alongside of an artificial irrigation from
the wells among them; palms in plenty&mdash;they were now heavy
laden with red-brown fruits; and a few peach or apricot trees
complete the general lineaments.&nbsp; The outer walls are low,
and serve more for the protection of the gardens than of the
dwellings; here are neither towers nor trenches, nor even, at
least in many places, any central castle or distinguishable
residence for the chief; his habitation is of the same
one-storied construction as those of his neighbors, only a little
larger.&nbsp; Some of the townlets are quite recent, and date
from <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>the
Shomer annexation, which gave this part of the province a degree
of quiet and prosperity unknown under their former Wahabee
rulers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning, the 10th of September, we were all up by
moonlight, two or three hours before dawn, and off on our road to
the southeast.&nbsp; The whole country that we had to traverse
for the next four days was of so uniform a character that a few
words of description may here serve for the landscape of this
entire stage of our journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upper Kaseem is an elevated plateau or steppe, and
forms part of a long upland belt, crossing diagonally the
northern half of the peninsula; one extremity reaches the
neighborhood of Zobeyr and the Euphrates, while the other extends
downward to the vicinity of Medina.&nbsp; Its surface is in
general covered with grass in the spring and summer seasons, and
with shrubs and brushwood at all times, and thus affords
excellent pasture for sheep and camels.&nbsp; Across it blows the
fresh eastern gale, so celebrated in Arab poetry under the name
of &lsquo;Seba Nedjin,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Zephyr of Nedjed&rsquo;
(only it comes from precisely the opposite corner to the Greek or
Roman Zephyr), and continually invoked by sentimental bards to
bring them news of imaginary loves or pleasing
reminiscences.&nbsp; No wonder; for most of these versifiers
being themselves natives of the barren Hedjaz or the scorching
Tehama, perhaps inhabitants of Egypt and Syria, and knowing
little of Arabia, except what they have seen on the dreary Meccan
pilgrim road, they naturally look back to with longing, and
frequently record, whatever glimpses chance may have allowed them
of <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>the
cooler and more fertile highlands of the centre, denominated by
them Nedjed, in a general way, with their transient experience of
its fresh and invigorating climate, of its courteous men and
sprightly maidens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when, nor is this seldom, the sweet smell of the
aromatic thyme-like plants that here abound mixes with the light
morning breeze and enhances its balmy influence, then indeed can
one excuse the raptures of an Arab Ovid or Theocritus, and
appreciate&mdash;at least I often did&mdash;their yearnings after
Nedjed, and all the praises they lavish on its memory.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then said I to my companion, while the
camels were hastening<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To bear us down the pass between Meneefah and
Demar,<br />
&lsquo;Enjoy while thou canst the sweets of the meadows of
Nedjed:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With no such meadows and sweets shalt thou meet
after this evening.</p>
<p>Ah! heaven&rsquo;s blessing on the scented gales of Nedjed,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And its greensward and groves glittering from the
spring shower,<br />
And thy dear friends, when thy lot was cast awhile in Nedjed,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Little hadst thou to complain of what the days
brought thee;</p>
<p>Months flew past, they passed and we perceived not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor when their moons were new, nor when they
waned.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For three days more they travelled forward over this
undulating table-land, making from sixty to seventy miles a
day.&nbsp; The view was extensive, but rather monotonous.&nbsp;
There were no high mountains, no rivers, no lakes, no deep
valleys; but a constant <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>repetition of stony uplands, shallow
and sandy hollows, and villages surrounded by belts of
palm-groves, the extent and direction of which indicated the
subterranean water-courses.</p>
<p>On the third evening they reached Kowarah, the most southern
station in Telal territory&mdash;a large village, lying in a
wooded and well-watered hollow.&nbsp; Here they still found the
order and security which that ruler had established, and
maintained everywhere throughout his dominions.&nbsp; Leaving the
next morning, the 14th of September, they crossed a few low
hills, came to a sudden dip in the general level of the country,
and then the extent of Southern Kaseem burst suddenly upon their
view.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, for the first time,&rdquo; says Palgrave,
&ldquo;we could in some measure appreciate the strength of the
Wahabee in his mastery over such a land.&nbsp; Before us to the
utmost horizon stretched an immense plain, studded with towns and
villages, towers and groves, all steeped in the dazzling noon,
and announcing everywhere life, opulence, and activity.&nbsp; The
average breadth of this populous district is about sixty miles,
its length twice as much, or more; it lies full two hundred feet
below the level of the uplands, which here break off like a
wall.&nbsp; Fifty or more good-sized villages and four or five
large towns form the commercial and agricultural centres of the
province, and its surface is moreover thickly strewn with smaller
hamlets, isolated wells, and gardens, and traversed by a net-work
of tracks in every direction.&nbsp; Here begin, and hence extend
to Djebel Toweyk itself, the series of high watch-towers that
afford the <a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>inhabitants a means, denied otherwise by their level
flats, of discerning from afar the approach of foray or invasion,
and thus preparing for resistance.&nbsp; For while no part of
Central Arabia has an older or a better established title to
civilization or wealth, no part also has been the starting-point
and theatre of so many wars, or witnessed the gathering of such
numerous armies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We halted for a moment on the verge of the uplands to
enjoy the magnificent prospect before us.&nbsp; Below lay the
wide plain; at a few miles&rsquo; distance we saw the thick
palm-groves of &rsquo;Eyoon, and what little of its towers and
citadel the dense foliage permitted to the eye.&nbsp; Far off on
our right, that is, to the west, a large dark patch marked the
tillage and plantations which girdle the town of Rass; other
villages and hamlets, too, were thickly scattered over the
landscape.&nbsp; All along the ridge where we stood, and visible
at various distances down the level, rose the tall, circular
watch-towers of Kaseem.&nbsp; But immediately before us stood a
more remarkable monument, one that fixed the attention and wonder
even of our Arab companions themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For hardly had we descended the narrow path where it
winds from ledge to ledge down to the bottom, when we saw before
us several huge stones, like enormous bowlders, placed endways
perpendicularly on the soil, while some of them yet upheld
similar masses laid transversely over their summit.&nbsp; They
were arranged in a curve, once forming part, it would appear, of
a large circle, and many other like fragments lay rolled on the
ground at a moderate <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>distance; the number of those still
upright was, to speak by memory, eight or nine.&nbsp; Two, at
about ten or twelve feet apart one from the other, and resembling
huge gate-posts, yet bore their horizontal lintel, a long block
laid across them; a few were deprived of their upper traverse,
the rest supported each its headpiece in defiance of time and of
the more destructive efforts of man.&nbsp; So nicely balanced did
one of these cross-bars appear that, in hope it might prove a
rocking-stone, I guided my camel right under it, and then
stretching up my riding-stick at arm&rsquo;s-length could just
manage to touch and push it, but it did not stir.&nbsp; Meanwhile
the respective heights of camel, rider, and stick taken together
would place the stone in question full fifteen feet from the
ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These blocks seem, by their quality, to have been hewn
from the neighboring limestone cliff, and roughly shaped, but
present no further trace of art, no groove or cavity of
sacrificial import, much less anything intended for figure or
ornament.&nbsp; The people of the country attribute their
erection to Darim, and by his own hands, too, seeing that he was
a giant; perhaps, also, for some magical ceremony, since he was a
magician.&nbsp; Pointing toward Rass, our companions affirmed
that a second and similar stone circle, also of gigantic
dimensions, existed there; and, lastly, they mentioned a third
toward the southwest, that is, on the confines of Hedjaz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, as in most parts of Arabia, the staple article of
cultivation is the date-palm.&nbsp; Of this tree there are,
however, many widely differing species, and Kaseem can boast of
containing the best known <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>anywhere, the Khalas of Hasa alone
excepted.&nbsp; The ripening season coincides with the latter
half of August and the first of September, and we had thus an
ample opportunity for testing the produce.&nbsp; Those who, like
most Europeans at home, only know the date from the dried
specimens of that fruit shown beneath a label in shop-windows,
can hardly imagine how delicious it is when eaten fresh and in
Central Arabia.&nbsp; Nor is it, when newly gathered, heating, a
defect inherent to the preserved fruit everywhere; nor does its
richness, however great, bring satiety: in short, it is an
article of food alike pleasant and healthy.&nbsp; Its cheapness
in its native land might astonish a Londoner.&nbsp; Enough of the
very best dates from the Bereydah gardens to fill a large Arab
handkerchief, about fifteen inches each way, almost to bursting,
cost Barakat and myself the moderate sum of three
farthings.&nbsp; We hung it up from the roof-beam of our
apartment to preserve the luscious fruit from the ants, and it
continued to drip molten sweetness into a sugary pool on the
floor below for three days together, before we had demolished the
contents, though it figured at every dinner and supper during
that period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were soon under the outer walls of &rsquo;Eyoon, a
good-sized town containing at least ten thousand inhabitants
according to my rough computation.&nbsp; Its central site, at the
very juncture of the great northern and western lines of
communication, renders it important, and for this reason it is
carefully fortified, that is, for the country, and furnished with
watchtowers much resembling manufactory chimneys, in <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>size and
shape, beside a massive and capacious citadel.&nbsp; My readers
may anticipate analogous, though proportionate, features in most
other towns and villages of this province.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the town-walls and the sand-hills close by was
a sheltered spot, where we took about four hours of sleep, till
the waning moon rose.&nbsp; Then all were once more in movement,
camels gnarling, men loading, and the doctor and his apprentice
mounting their beasts, all for Bereydah.&nbsp; But that town was
distant, and when day broke at last there was yet a long road to
traverse.&nbsp; This now lay amid mounds and valleys, thick with
the vegetation already described; and somewhat after sunrise we
took a full hour to pass the gardens and fields of Ghat, a
straggling village, where a dozen wells supplied the valley with
copious irrigation.&nbsp; On the adjoining hillocks&mdash;I may
not call them heights&mdash;was continued the series of
watch-towers, corresponding with others farther off that belonged
to villages seen by glimpses in the landscape; I heard, but soon
forgot, their names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A march of ten or twelve hours had tired us, and the
weather was oppressively close, no uncommon phenomenon in Kaseem,
where, what between low sandy ground and a southerly latitude,
the climate is much more sultry than in Djebel Shomer, or the
mountains of Toweyk.&nbsp; So that we were very glad when the
ascent of a slight eminence discovered to our gaze the
long-desired town of Bereydah, whose oval fortifications rose to
view amid an open and cultivated plain.&nbsp; It was a view for
Turner.&nbsp; An enormous watch-tower, near a hundred feet in <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>height, a
minaret of scarce inferior proportions, a mass of bastioned
walls, such as we had not yet witnessed in Arabia, green groves
around and thickets of ithel, all under the dreamy glare of noon,
offered a striking spectacle, far surpassing whatever I had
anticipated, and announced populousness and wealth.&nbsp; We
longed to enter those gates and walk those streets.&nbsp; But we
had yet a delay to wear out.&nbsp; At about a league from the
town our guide, Mubarek, led us off the main road to the right,
up and down several little but steep sand-hills, and hot
declivities, till about two in the afternoon, half-roasted with
the sun, we reached, never so weary, his garden gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning was bright, yet cool, when we got free of
the maze of ithel and sand-slopes, and entered the lanes that
traverse the garden circle round the town, in all quiet and
security.&nbsp; But our approach to Bereydah was destined to
furnish us an unexpected and undesired surprise, though indeed
less startling than that which discomposed our first arrival at
Ha&rsquo;yel.&nbsp; We had just passed a well near the angle of a
garden wall, when we saw a man whose garb and appearance at once
bespoke him for a muleteer of the north, watering a couple of
mules at the pool hard by.&nbsp; Barakat and I stared with
astonishment, and could hardly believe our eyes.&nbsp; For since
the day we left Gaza for the southeastern desert we had never met
with a like dress, nor with these animals; and how, then, came
they here?&nbsp; But there was no mistaking either the man or the
beasts, and as the muleteer raised his head to look at the
passers-by, he also started at our sight, and evidently <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>recognized
in us something that took him unawares.&nbsp; But the riddle was
soon solved.&nbsp; A few paces farther on, our way opened out on
the great plain that lies immediately under the town walls to the
north.&nbsp; This space was now covered with tents and thronged
with men of foreign dress and bearing, mixed with Arabs of town
and desert, women and children, talking and quarrelling, buying
and selling, going and coming; everywhere baskets full of dates
and vegetables, platters bearing eggs and butter, milk and whey,
meat hung on poles, bundles of firewood, etc., stood ranged in
rows, horsemen and camel-men were riding about between groups
seated round fires or reclining against their baggage; in the
midst of all this medley a gilt ball surmounted a large white
pavilion of a make that I had not seen since last I left India,
some eleven years before, and numerous smaller tents of striped
cloth, and certainly not of Arab fashion, clustered around; a
lively scene, especially of a clear morning, but requiring some
explanation from its exotic and non-Arab character.&nbsp; These
tents belonged to the great caravan of Persian pilgrims, on their
return from Medina to Meshid &rsquo;Alee by the road of Kaseem,
and hence all this unusual concourse and bustle.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing a little on to the east, we left the crowded
encampment on one side and turned to enter the city gates.&nbsp;
Here, and this is generally the case in the larger Arab towns of
old date, the fortifications surround houses alone, and the
gardens all lie without, sometimes defended&mdash;at
&rsquo;Oneyzah, for example&mdash;by a second outer girdle of
walls and <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>towers, but sometimes, as at Bereydah, devoid of any
mural protection.&nbsp; The town itself is composed exclusively
of streets, houses, and market-places, and bears in consequence a
more regular appearance than the recent and village-like
arrangements of the Djowf and even of Ha&rsquo;yel.&nbsp; We
passed a few streets, tolerably large but crooked, and then made
the camels kneel down in a little square or public place, where I
remained seated by them on the baggage, switch in hand, like an
ordinary Arab traveller, and Barakat with Mubarek went in search
of lodgings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very long did the half-hour seem to me during which I
had thus to mount guard till my companions returned from their
quest; the streets were full of people, and a disagreeable crowd
of the lower sort was every moment collecting round myself and my
camels, with all the inquisitiveness of the idle and vulgar in
every land.&nbsp; At last my companions came back to say that
they had found what they wanted; a kick or two brought the camels
on their legs again, and we moved off to our new quarters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The house in question was hardly more than five
minutes&rsquo; walk from the north gate, and at about an equal
distance only from the great market-place on the other
side.&nbsp; Its position was therefore good.&nbsp; It possessed
two large rooms on the ground story, and three smaller, besides a
spacious court-yard, surrounded by high walls.&nbsp; A winding
stair of irregular steps and badly lighted, like all in the
Nedjed, led up to an extent of flat roof, girt round by a parapet
six feet high, and divided into two compartments by <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>a
cross-wall, thus affording a very tolerable place for occupation
morning and evening, at the hours when the side-walls might yet
project enough shade to shelter those seated alongside of them,
besides an excellent sleeping place for night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day after their arrival they made a call upon Mohanna, the
ruler of Bereydah, in order to ask his assistance in proceeding
to Nedjed.&nbsp; But he was too busy in devising means to exact
more tribute-money from the Persian pilgrims to give any notice
to two persons whose dress and appearance gave no token of
wealth.&nbsp; This neglect afterward proved to be a piece of good
fortune.&nbsp; They then spent several days in a vain attempt to
find camels and guides; no one was willing to undertake the
service.&nbsp; The central province of Nedjed, the genuine
Wahabee country, is to the rest of Arabia a sort of lion&rsquo;s
den, into which few venture and yet fewer return.&nbsp; An
elderly man of Bereydah, of whom Palgrave demanded information,
simply replied, &ldquo;It is Nedjed; he who enters it does not
come out again,&rdquo; and this is almost literally true.&nbsp;
Its mountains, once the fastnesses of robbers and assassins, are
at the present day equally, or even more, formidable as the
stronghold of fanatics who consider everyone save themselves an
infidel or a heretic, and who regard the slaughter of an infidel
or a heretic as a duty, at least a merit.&nbsp; In addition to
this general cause of anticipating a worse than cold reception in
Nedjed, wars and bloodshed, aggression and tyranny, have
heightened the original antipathy of the surrounding population
into special and definite resentment for wrongs received, perhaps
<a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>inflicted, till Nedjed has become for all but her born
sons doubly dangerous and doubly hateful.</p>
<p>Another circumstance, which seemed to make Palgrave&rsquo;s
situation more difficult, although it was equally fortunate in
the end, was a rebellion which had broken out in the neighboring
city of &rsquo;Oneyzah, headed by Zamil, a native chief.&nbsp;
The town was at that time besieged by the Wahabees, yet held out
gallantly, and the sympathy of the people of all Kaseem was so
strongly on the side of Zamil, that only the presence of the
Wahabee troops in Bereydah kept that city, also, from
revolt.&nbsp; The rebels had sent deputations to Mecca and also
to Djebel Shomer for assistance, and there seemed to be some
possibility of a general Central Arabian revolt against the hated
Wahabee supremacy.&nbsp; It seemed thus to be a most unpropitious
time for penetrating the stronghold of Nedjed.&nbsp; Palgrave did
not so much fear the suspicion of being a European, as that of
being an Ottoman spy.&nbsp; His first need, however, was the
means of going forward safely.&nbsp; He thus described how an
apparent chance made him acquainted with the man to whom almost
the entire success of his later travels was due:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the sixth day after our arrival, and the 22d of
September, when about noon I was sitting alone and rather
melancholy, and trying to beguile the time with reading the
incomparable Divan of Ebn-el-Farid, the favorite companion of my
travels.&nbsp; Barakat had at my request betaken himself out of
doors, less in hopes of success than to &lsquo;go to and fro in
the earth and walk up and down in it;&rsquo; nor did <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>I now dare
to expect that he would return any wiser than he had set
forth.&nbsp; When lo! after a long two hours&rsquo; absence he
came in with cheerful face, index of good tidings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, indeed, they were, none better.&nbsp; Their
bearer said, that after roaming awhile to no purport through the
streets and market-place, he had bethought him of a visit to the
Persian camp.&nbsp; There, while straying among the tents,
&lsquo;like a washerwoman&rsquo;s dog,&rsquo; as a Hindoo would
say, he noticed somewhat aloof from the crowd a small group of
pilgrims seated near their baggage on the sand, while curls of
smoke going up from amid the circle indicated the presence of a
fire, which at that time of day could be for nothing else than
coffee.&nbsp; Civilized though Barakat undoubtedly was, he was
yet by blood and heart an Arab, and for an Arab to see
coffee-making and not to put himself in the way of getting a
share would be an act of self-restraint totally unheard of.&nbsp;
So he approached the group, and was of course invited to sit down
and drink.&nbsp; The party consisted of two wealthy Persians,
accompanied by three or four of that class of men, half-servants,
half-companions, who often hook on to travellers at Bagdad or its
neighborhood, besides a mulatto of Arabo-negrine origin, and his
master, this last being the leader of the band, and the giver of
the aromatic entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barakat&rsquo;s whole attention was at once engrossed
by this personage.&nbsp; A remarkably handsome face, of a type
evidently not belonging to the Arab peninsula, long hair curling
down to the shoulders, an over-dress <a name="page195"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 195</span>of fine spun silk, somewhat soiled
by travel, a colored handkerchief of Syrian manufacture on the
head, a manner and look indicating an education much superior to
that ordinary in his class and occupation, a
camel-driver&rsquo;s, were peculiarities sufficient of themselves
to attract notice, and give rise to conjecture.&nbsp; But when
these went along with a welcome and a salute in the forms and
tone of Damascus or Aleppo, and a ready flow of that
superabundant and overcharged politeness for which the Syrian
subjects of the Turkish empire are renowned, Barakat could no
longer doubt that he had a fellow-countryman, and one, too, of
some note, before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such was in fact the case.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa, to
give him the name by which he was commonly known in these parts,
though in his own country he bears another denomination, was a
native of Aleppo, and son of a not unimportant individual in that
fair city.&nbsp; His education, and the circumstances of his
early youth, had rendered him equally conversant with townsmen
and herdsmen, with citizens and Bedouins, with Arabs and
Europeans.&nbsp; By lineal descent he was a Bedouin, since his
grandfather belonged to the Mejadimah, who are themselves an
offshoot of the Benoo-Khalid; but in habits, thoughts, and
manners he was a very son of Aleppo, where he had passed the
greater part of his boyhood and youth.&nbsp; When about
twenty-five years of age he became involved, culpably or not, in
the great conspiracy against the Turkish government which broke
out in the Aleppine insurrection of 1852.&nbsp; Like many others
he was compelled to anticipate consequences by a prompt
flight.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;After trying commerce in order to retrieve his
ruined fortunes, but with ill success, Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa engaged
in the horse trade between Persia and Arabia, and also
failed.&nbsp; He then went to Ri&rsquo;ad, the capital of Nedjed,
and by presents to Feysul, the chief, obtained a post as guide to
the Persian caravans of pilgrims to Mecca, across Arabia.&nbsp;
At this time he had followed that career for three years, and had
amassed considerable wealth, for his politeness, easy manners,
and strict probity made him popular with the pilgrims.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He recognized a fellow-countryman in Barakat,&rdquo;
says Palgrave, &ldquo;received him with marked politeness, and
carefully informed himself of our whence and whither.&nbsp;
Barakat, overjoyed to find at last a kind of opening after
difficulties that had appeared to obstruct all further progress,
made no delay in inquiring whether he would undertake our
guidance to Ri&rsquo;ad.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa replied that he
was just on the point of separating from his friends the
Persians, whose departure would leave camels enough and to spare
at his disposition, and that so far there was no hindrance to the
proposal.&nbsp; As for the Wahabees and their unwillingness to
admit strangers within their limits, he stated himself to be well
known to them, and that in his company we should have nothing to
fear from their suspicious criticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The agreement was made at once, and the travellers now only
waited until their new companion should have made some final
arrangements with the Persian pilgrims, who were to travel
directly from Bereydah to Bagdad.&nbsp; In the meantime, the
former <a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>took advantage of the delay to see as much as possible
of the place, and even to make excursions in the neighborhood,
especially in the direction of the beleaguered city of
&rsquo;Oneyzah.&nbsp; Palgrave&rsquo;s description of the place
shows that it possesses the same general features as the other
Arabian towns, yet may be quoted for its intrinsic
picturesqueness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barakat and myself have made our morning household
purchases at the fair, and the sun being now an hour or more
above the horizon, we think it time to visit the market-place of
the town, which would hardly be open sooner.&nbsp; We re-enter
the city gate, and pass on our way by our house door, where we
leave our bundle of eatables, and regain the high street of
Bereydah.&nbsp; Before long we reach a high arch across the road;
this gate divides the market from the rest of the quarter.&nbsp;
We enter.&nbsp; First of all we see a long range of
butchers&rsquo; shops on either side, thick hung with flesh of
sheep and camel, and very dirtily kept.&nbsp; Were not the air
pure and the climate healthy, the plague would assuredly be
endemic here; but in Arabia no special harm seems to
follow.&nbsp; We hasten on, and next pass a series of cloth and
linen warehouses, stocked partly with home manufacture, but more
imported; Bagdad cloaks and head-gear, for instance, Syrian
shawls and Egyptian slippers.&nbsp; Here markets follow the law
general throughout the East, that all shops or stores of the same
description should be clustered together, a system whose
advantages on the whole outweigh its inconveniences, at least for
small towns like these.&nbsp; In the large cities and capitals of
Europe greater extent <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>of locality requires evidently a
different method of arrangement; it might be awkward for the
inhabitants of Hyde Park were no hatters to be found nearer than
the Tower.&nbsp; But what is Bereydah compared even with a
second-rate European city?&nbsp; However, in a crowd, it yields
to none; the streets at this time of the day are thronged to
choking, and to make matters worse, a huge, splay-footed camel
comes every now and then, heaving from side to side like a
lubber-rowed boat, with a long beam on his back menacing the
heads of those in the way, or with two enormous loads of
firewood, each as large as himself, sweeping the road before him
of men, women, and children, while the driver, high-perched on
the hump, regards such trifles with the most supreme
indifference, so long as he brushes his path open.&nbsp;
Sometimes there is a whole string of these beasts, the head-rope
of each tied to the crupper of his precursor, very uncomfortable
passengers when met with at a narrow turning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through such obstacles we have found or made our way,
and are now amid leather and shoemakers&rsquo; shops, then among
coppersmiths and ironsmiths, whose united clang might waken the
dead or kill the living, till at last we emerge on the central
town-square, not a bad one either, nor very irregular,
considering that it is in Kaseem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vegetable and fruit market is very extensive, and
kept almost exclusively by women; so are also the shops for
grocery and spices.&nbsp; Nor do the fair sex of Bereydah seem a
whit inferior to their rougher partners in knowledge of business
and thrifty <a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>diligence.&nbsp; &lsquo;Close-handedness beseems a
woman no less than generosity a man,&rsquo; says an Arab poet,
unconsciously coinciding with Lance of Verona in his comments on
the catalogue of his future spouse&rsquo;s
&lsquo;conditions.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole town has an aspect of old but declining
prosperity.&nbsp; There are few new houses, but many falling into
ruin.&nbsp; The faces, too, of most we meet are serious, and
their voices in an undertone.&nbsp; Silk dresses are prohibited
by the dominant faction, and tobacco can only be smoked within
doors, and by stealth.&nbsp; Every now and then zealous Wahabee
missionaries from Ri&rsquo;ad pay a visit of reform and preaching
to unwilling auditors, and disobedience to the customs of the
Nedjean sect is noticed and punished, often severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough of the town; the streets are narrow, hot, and
dusty; the day, too, advances; but the gardens are yet
cool.&nbsp; So we dash at a venture through a labyrinth of
by-ways and cross-ways till we find ourselves in the wide street
that, like a boulevard in France, runs immediately along but
inside the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We stroll about in the shade, hide ourselves amid the
high maize to smoke a quiet pipe unobserved by prying Nedjean
eyes, and then walk on till at some distance we come under a high
ridge of sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While on one of our suburban excursions we took the
direction of &rsquo;Oneyzah, but found it utterly impossible to
arrive within its walls; so we contented ourselves with an
outside and distant view of this large and populous town; the
number of its <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>houses, and their size, judging by the overtopping
summits that marked out the dwelling of Zamil and his family, far
surpassed anything in Bereydah.&nbsp; The outer fortifications
are enormously thick, and the girdle of palm-trees between them
and the town affords a considerable additional defence to the
latter.&nbsp; For all I could see there is little stonework in
the construction; they appear almost exclusively of unbaked
bricks; yet even so they are formidable defences for
Arabia.&nbsp; The whole country around, and whatever lay
northeast toward Bereydah, was more or less ravaged by the war;
and we were blamed by our friends as very rash in having ventured
thus far; in fact, it was a mere chance that we did not fall in
with skirmishers or plunderers; and in such a case the military
discipline of Kaseem would hardly have insured our safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When all was ready for the long-expected departure, it
was definitely fixed for the 3d of October, a Friday, I think, at
nightfall.&nbsp; Since our first interview Barakat and myself had
not again presented ourselves before Mohanna, except in chance
meetings, accompanied by distant salutations in the street or
market-place; and we did not see any need for paying him a
special farewell call.&nbsp; Indeed, after learning who and what
he was, we did our best not to draw his gray eye on us, and
thereby escaped some additional trouble and surplus duties to
pay, nor did any one mention us to him.&nbsp; At star-rise we
bade our host and householder Ahmed a final adieu, and left the
town with Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa for our guide.&rdquo;</p>

201</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Journey To Ri&rsquo;ad The Capital Of
Nedjed</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> roads lay before us.&nbsp; The
shorter, and for that reason the more frequented of the two, led
southeast-by-east through Woshem and Wady Haneefah to
Ri&rsquo;ad.&nbsp; But this track passed through a district often
visited at the present moment by the troops of &rsquo;Oneyzah and
their allies, and hence our companions, not over-courageous for
the most, were afraid to follow it.&nbsp; Another road, much more
circuitous, but farther removed from the scene of military
operations, led northeast to Zulphah, and thence entered the
province of Sedeyr, which it traversed in a southeasterly or
southern direction, and thus reached the &rsquo;Aared.&nbsp; Our
council of war resolved on the latter itinerary, nor did we
ourselves regret a roundabout which promised to procure us the
sight of much that we might scarcely have otherwise an
opportunity of visiting.&nbsp; Barakat and I were mounted on two
excellent dromedaries of Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa&rsquo;s stud; the
Na&rsquo;ib <a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a> was on a lovely gray she camel with <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>a handsome
saddle, crimson and gold.&nbsp; The Meccans shared between them a
long-backed black beast; the rest were also mounted on camels or
dromedaries, since the road before us was impracticable for
horses, at any rate at this time of year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our road lay in Kaseem, whose highlands we rejoined
once more, and traversed till sunset.&nbsp; The view was very
beautiful from its extent and variety of ups and downs, in broad,
grassy hills; little groups of trees stood in scattered
detachments around; and had a river, that desideratum of Arabia,
been in sight, one might almost have fancied one&rsquo;s self in
the country bordering the Lower Rhine for some part of its
course; readers may suppose, too, that there was less verdure
here than in the European parallel&mdash;my comparison bears only
on the general turn of the view.&nbsp; No river exists nearer
Kaseem than Shatt (Euphrates), some hundred leagues off, and our
eyes had been too long accustomed to the deceptive pools of the
mirage to associate with them even a passing idea of aught save
drought and heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We journeyed on till dark, and then reached certain
hillocks of a different character from the hard ground lately
under our feet.&nbsp; Here began the Nefood, whose course from
the southwest to northeast, and then north, parts between Kaseem,
Woshem, and Sedeyr.&nbsp; I have already said something of these
sandy inlets when describing that which we crossed three months
ago between Djowf and Shomer.</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>&ldquo;On the verge of the desert strip we now halted a
little to eat a hasty supper, and to drink&mdash;the Arabs coffee
and the Persians tea.&nbsp; But journeying in these sands, under
the heat of the day, is alike killing to man and beast, and
therefore Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa had resolved that we should cross the
greater portion under favor of the cooler hours of night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All night, a weary night, we waded up and down through
waves of sand, in which the camels often sank up to their knees,
and their riders were obliged to alight and help them on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now by full daylight appeared the true character of the
region which we were traversing; its aspect resembled the Nefood
north of Djebel Shomer, but the undulations were here higher and
deeper, and the sand itself lighter and less stable.&nbsp; In
most spots neither shrub nor blade of grass could fix its root,
in others a scanty vegetation struggled through, but no trace of
man anywhere.&nbsp; The camels ploughed slowly on; the Persians,
unaccustomed to such scenes, were downcast and silent; all were
tired, and no wonder.&nbsp; At last, a little before noon, and
just as the sun&rsquo;s heat was becoming intolerable, we reached
the verge of an immense crater-like hollow, certainly three or
four miles in circumference, where the sand-billows receded on
every side, and left in the midst a pit seven or eight hundred
feet in depth, at whose base we could discern a white gleam of
limestone rock, and a small group of houses, trees, and gardens,
thus capriciously isolated in the very heart of the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was the little village and oasis of Wasit, or <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>&lsquo;the
intermediary,&rsquo; so called because a central point between
the three provinces of Kaseem, Sedeyr, and Woshem, yet belonging
to none of them.&nbsp; Nor is it often visited by wayfarers, as
we learned from the inhabitants, men simple and half-savage, from
their little intercourse with the outer world, and unacquainted
even with the common forms of Islamitic prayer, though dwelling
in the midst of the Wahabee dominions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long, winding descent brought us to the bottom of the
valley, where on our arrival men and boys came out to stare at
the Persians, and by exacting double prices for fruit and
camel&rsquo;s milk proved themselves not altogether such fools as
they looked.&nbsp; For us, regarded as Arabs, we enjoyed their
hospitality&mdash;it was necessarily a limited one&mdash;gratis;
whereupon the Na&rsquo;ib grew jealous, and declaimed against the
Arabs as &lsquo;infidels,&rsquo; for not treating with suitable
generosity pilgrims like themselves returning from the
&lsquo;house of God.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get out of this pit was no easy matter; <i>facilis
descensus</i>, etc., thought I; no ascending path showed itself
in the required direction, and every one tried to push up his
floundering beast where the sand appeared at a manageable slope,
and firm to the footing.&nbsp; Camels and men fell and rolled
back down the declivity, till some of the party shed tears of
vexation, and others, more successful, laughed at the annoyance
of their companions.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa ran about from one to
the other, attempting to direct and keep them together, till
finally, as Heaven willed, we reached the upper rim to the
north.</p>
<p><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>&ldquo;Before us lay what seemed a storm-driven sea of
fire in the red light of afternoon, and through it we wound our
way, till about an hour before sunset we fell in with a sort of
track or furrow.&nbsp; Next opened out on our road a long
descent, at whose extreme base we discerned the important and
commercial town of Zulphah.&nbsp; Beyond it rose the wall-like
steeps of Djebel Toweyk, so often heard of, and now seen close at
hand.&nbsp; Needless to say how joyfully we welcomed the first
view of that strange ridge, the heart and central knot of Arabia,
beyond which whatever lay might almost be reckoned as a return
journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had now, in fact, crossed the Nefood, and had at our
feet the great valley which constitutes the main line of
communication between Nedjed and the north, reaching even to the
Tigris and Bagdad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We passed the whole length of the town of Zulphah,
several streets of which had been lately swept away by the winter
torrents that pour at times their short-lived fury down this
valley.&nbsp; Before us to the southeast stretched the long
hollow; on our right was the Nefood, on our left Djebel Toweyk
and the province of Sedeyr.&nbsp; The mountain air blew cool, and
this day&rsquo;s journey was a far pleasanter one than its
predecessor.&nbsp; We continued our march down the valley till
the afternoon, when we turned aside into a narrow gorge running
up at a sharp angle to the northeast, and thus entered between
the heights of Djebel Toweyk itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This mountain essentially constitutes Nedjed.&nbsp; It
is a wide and flat chain, or rather plateau, whose general form
is that of a huge crescent.&nbsp; If I may <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>be
permitted here to give my rough guess regarding the elevation of
the main plateau, a guess grounded partly on the vegetation,
climate, and similar local features, partly on an approximate
estimate of the ascent itself, and of the subsequent descent on
the other or sea side, I should say that it varies from a height
of one to two thousand feet above the surrounding level of the
peninsula, and may thus be about three thousand feet at most
above the sea.&nbsp; Its loftiest ledges occur in the Sedeyr
district, where we shall pass them before long; the centre and
the southwesterly arm is certainly lower.&nbsp; Djebel Toweyk is
the middle knot of Arabia, its Caucasus, so to say; and is still,
as it has often been in former times, the turning-point of the
whole, or almost the whole, peninsula in a political and national
bearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The climate of the northern part of Djebel Toweyk,
whether plateau or valley, coincident with the province of
Sedeyr, is perhaps one of the healthiest in the world; an
exception might be made in favor of Djebel Shomer alone.&nbsp;
The above named districts resemble each other closely in dryness
of atmosphere, and the inhabitants of Sedeyr, like those of
Shomer, are remarkable for their ruddy complexion and
well-developed stature.&nbsp; But when we approach the centre of
the mountain crescent, where its whole level lowers, while the
more southerly latitude brings it nearer to the prevailing
influences of the tropical zone, the air becomes damper and more
relaxing, and a less salubrious climate pictures itself in the
sallower faces and slender make of its denizens.</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>&ldquo;Two days later we attained the great plateau, of
which I have a few pages since given an anticipated
description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About noon we halted in a brushwood-covered plain to
light fire and prepare coffee.&nbsp; After which we pursued our
easterly way, still a little to the north, now and then meeting
with travellers or peasants; but a European would find these
roads very lonely in comparison with those of his own
country.&nbsp; All the more did I admire the perfect submission
and strict police enforced by the central government, so that
even a casual robbery is very rare in the provinces, and
highwaymen are totally out of the question.&nbsp; At last, near
the same hour of afternoon that had brought us the day before to
Ghat, we came in sight of Mejmaa&rsquo;, formerly capital of the
province, and still a place of considerable importance, with a
population, to judge by appearances and hearsay, of between ten
and twelve thousand souls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were up early next morning, for the night air was
brisk, and a few hours of sleep had sufficed us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After sunrise we came on a phenomenon of a nature, I
believe, without a second or a parallel in Central Arabia, yet
withal most welcome, namely, a tolerably large source of running
water, forming a wide and deepish stream, with grassy banks, and
frogs croaking in the herbage.&nbsp; We opened our eyes in
amazement; it was the first of the kind that we had beheld since
leaving the valley of Djowf.&nbsp; But though a living, it is a
short-lived rivulet, reaching only four or five hours&rsquo;
distance to Djelajil, where it is lost amid the plantations of
the suburbs.</p>
<p><a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>&ldquo;We had not long traversed the Meteyr encampment,
when we came in view of the walls of Toweym, a large town,
containing between twelve and fifteen thousand inhabitants,
according to the computation here in use, and which I follow for
want of better.&nbsp; The houses are here built compactly, of two
stories in general, sometimes three; the lower rooms are often
fifteen or sixteen feet high, and the upper ten or twelve; while
the roof itself is frequently surrounded by a blind wall of six
feet or more, till the whole attains a fair altitude, and is not
altogether unimposing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early next day, at a short distance from Toweym, we
passed another large village with battlemented walls, and on the
opposite side of the road a square castle, looking very
medi&aelig;val; this was Hafr.&nbsp; A couple of hours further on
we reached Thomeyr, a straggling townlet, more abounding in
broken walls than houses; close by was a tall white rock, crowned
by the picturesque remains of an old outwork or fort, overlooking
the place.&nbsp; Here our party halted for breakfast in the
shadow of the ruins.&nbsp; Barakat and myself determined to try
our fortune in the village itself; no guards appeared at its open
gate; we entered unchallenged, and roamed through silent lanes
and heaps of rubbish, vainly seeking news of milk and dates in
this city of the dead.&nbsp; At last we met a meagre townsman, in
look and apparel the apothecary of Romeo; and of him, not without
misgivings of heart, we inquired where aught eatable could be had
for love or money.&nbsp; He apologized, though there was scarce
need of that, for not having <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>any such article at his disposal;
&lsquo;but,&rsquo; added he, &lsquo;in such and such a house
there will certainly be something good,&rsquo; and thitherward he
preceded us in our search.&nbsp; We found indeed a large
dwelling, but the door was shut; we knocked to no purpose: nobody
at home.</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our man now set us a bolder example, and we altogether
scrambled through a breach in the mud wall, and found ourselves
amid empty rooms and a desolate court-yard.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Everybody is out in the fields, women only
excepted,&rsquo; said our guide, and we separated, no better off
than before.&nbsp; Despairing of the village commissariat, we
climbed a turret on the outer walls, and looked round.&nbsp; Now
we saw at some distance a beautiful palm-grove, where we
concluded that dates could not be wanting, and off we set for it
across the stubble fields.&nbsp; But on arriving we found our
paradise surrounded by high walls, and no gate
discoverable.&nbsp; While thus we stood without, like
Milton&rsquo;s fiend at Eden, but unable, like him, &lsquo;by one
high bound to overleap all bound,&rsquo; up came a handsome
Solibah lad, all in rags, half-walking, half-dancing, in the
devil-may-care way of his tribe.&nbsp; &lsquo;Can you tell us
which is the way in?&rsquo; was our first question, pointing to
the garden before us; and, &lsquo;Shall I sing you a song?&rsquo;
was his first answer.&nbsp; &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want your
songs, but dates; how are we to get at them?&rsquo; we
replied.&nbsp; &lsquo;Or shall I perform you a dance?&rsquo;
answered the grinning young scoundrel, and forthwith began an
Arabian polka-step, laughing all the while at our undisguised
impatience.&nbsp; At last he condescended to show us the way, but
no other than <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>what befitted an orchard-robbing boy, like himself, for
it lay a little farther off, right over the wall, which he scaled
with practised ingenuity, and helped us to follow.&nbsp; So we
did, though perhaps with honester intentions, and, once within,
stood amid trees, shade, and water.&nbsp; The &lsquo;tender
juvenile&rsquo; then set up a shout, and soon a man appeared,
&lsquo;old Adam&rsquo;s likeness set to dress this garden,&rsquo;
save that he was not old but young, as Adam might himself have
been while yet in Eden.&nbsp; We were somewhat afraid of a surly
reception, too well merited by our very equivocal introduction;
but the gardener was better-tempered than many of his caste, and
after saluting us very politely, offered his services at our
disposal.&nbsp; We then proposed to purchase a stock of dates for
our onward way, whereon the gardener conducted us to an outhouse
where heaps of three or four kinds of this fruit, red and yellow,
round or long, lay piled up, and bade us choose.&nbsp; At his
recommendation we filled a large cloth, which we had brought with
us for the purpose, with excellent ruddy dates, and gave in
return a small piece of money, welcome here as elsewhere.&nbsp;
We then took leave and returned, but this time through the garden
gate, to the stubble fields, and passing under the broken walls
of the village, reached our companions, who had become anxious at
our absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For three days longer the travellers journeyed southward,
through the valleys branching out from Djebel Toweyk, encamping
for the night near some of the small towns.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
early gray of the fourth morning,&rdquo; says Palgrave, &ldquo;we
passed close under the <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>plantations of Rowdah down the
valley, now dry and still, once overflowed with the best blood of
Arabia, and through the narrow and high-walled pass which gives
entrance to the great strongholds of the land.&nbsp; The sun rose
and lighted up to our view wild precipices on either side, with a
tangled mass of broken rock and brushwood below, while coveys of
partridges started up at our feet, and deer scampered away by the
gorges to right or left, or a cloud of dust announced the
approach of peasant bands or horsemen going to and fro, and
gardens or hamlets gleamed through side openings or stood niched
in the bulging passes of the Wady itself, till before noon we
arrived at the little hamlet of Malka, or &lsquo;the
junction.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its name is derived from its position.&nbsp; Here the
valley divides in form of a Y, sending off two branches&mdash;one
southerly to Derey&rsquo;eeyah, the other southeast-by-east
through the centre of the province, and communicating with the
actual capital, Ri&rsquo;ad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa had meditated bringing us on that very
evening to Ri&rsquo;ad.&nbsp; But eight good leagues remained
from Malka to the capital; and when the Na&rsquo;ib had
terminated his cosmetic operations, the easterly turning shadows
left us no hope of attaining Ri&rsquo;ad before nightfall.&nbsp;
However, we resumed our march, and took the arm of the valley
leading to Derey&rsquo;eeyah; but before reaching it we once more
quitted the Wady, and followed a shorter path by the highlands to
the left.&nbsp; Our way was next crossed by a long range of
towers, built by Ibraheem Pasha, as outposts for the defence of
this important position.&nbsp; Within their line stood the lonely
walls of a large, <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>square barrack; the towers were what we sometimes call
Martello&mdash;short, large, and round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The level rays of the setting sun now streamed across
the plain, and we came on the ruins of Derey&rsquo;eeyah, filling
up the whole breadth of the valley beneath.&nbsp; The palace
walls, of unbaked brick, like the rest, rose close under the left
or northern edge, but unroofed and tenantless; a little lower
down a wide extent of fragments showed where the immense mosque
had been, and hard by, the market-place; a tower on an isolated
height was, I suppose, the original dwelling-place of the
Sa&rsquo;ood family, while yet mere local chieftains, before
growing greatness transferred them to their imperial
palace.&nbsp; The outer fortifications remained almost uninjured
for much of their extent, with turrets and bastions reddening in
the western light; in other places the Egyptian artillery, or the
process of years, had levelled them with the earth; within the
town many houses were yet standing, but uninhabited, and the
lines of the streets from gate to gate were distinct as in a
ground plan.&nbsp; From the great size of the town (for it is
full half a mile in length, and not much less in breadth), and
from the close packing of the houses, I should estimate its
capacity at above forty thousand indwellers.&nbsp; The gardens
lie without, and still &lsquo;living waved where man had ceased
to live,&rsquo; in full beauty and luxuriance, a deep green ring
around the gray ruins.&nbsp; For although the Nedjeans, holding
it for an ill omen to rebuild and reinhabit a town so fatally
overthrown, have transplanted the seat of government, and with it
the bulk of the city population, to Ri&rsquo;ad, they <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>have not
deemed it equally necessary to abandon the rich plantations and
well-watered fields belonging to the old capital; and thus a
small colony of gardeners in scattered huts and village dwellings
close under the walls protract the blighted existence of
Derey&rsquo;eeyah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While from our commanding elevation we gazed
thoughtfully on this scene, so full of remembrances, the sun set,
and darkness grew on.&nbsp; We naturally proposed a halt, but
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa turned a deaf ear, and affirmed that a garden
belonging to &rsquo;Abd-er-Rahman, already mentioned as grandson
of the first Wahabee, was but a little farther before us, and
better adapted to our night&rsquo;s rest than the ruins.&nbsp; In
truth, three hours of brisk travelling yet intervened between
Derey&rsquo;eeyah and the place in question; but our guide was
unwilling to enter Derey&rsquo;eeyah in company of Persians and
Syrians, Shiya&rsquo;ees and Christians; and this he afterward
confessed to me.&nbsp; For, whether from one of those curious
local influences which outlast even the change of races, and give
one abiding color to the successive tenants of the same spot, or
whether it be occasioned by the constant view of their fallen
greatness and the triumph of their enemies, the scanty population
of Derey&rsquo;eeyah comprises some of the bitterest and most
bigoted fanatics that even &rsquo;Aared can offer.&nbsp;
Accordingly we moved on, still keeping to the heights, and late
at night descended a little hollow, where, amid an extensive
garden, stood the country villa of &rsquo;Abd-er-Rahman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did not attempt to enter the house; indeed, at such
an hour no one was stirring to receive us.&nbsp; But a shed in
the garden close by sufficed for <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>travellers who were all too weary to
desire aught but sleep; and this we soon found in spite of dogs
and jackals, numerous here and throughout Nedjed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From this locality to the capital was about four
miles&rsquo; distance.&nbsp; Our party divided next morning; the
Na&rsquo;ib and his associates remaining behind, while Barakat
and myself, with Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa, set off straight for the town,
where our guide was to give notice at the palace of the approach
of the Persian dignitary, that the honors due to his reception
might meet him half-way.&nbsp; At our request the Meccans stayed
also in the rear; we did not desire the equivocal effect of their
company on a first appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For about an hour we proceeded southward, through
barren and undulating ground, unable to see over the country to
any distance.&nbsp; At last we attained a rising eminence, and
crossing it, came at once in full view of Ri&rsquo;ad, the main
object of our long journey&mdash;the capital of Nedjed and half
Arabia, its very heart of hearts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before us stretched a wild open valley, and in its
foreground, immediately below the pebbly slope on whose summit we
stood, lay the capital, large and square, crowned by high towers
and strong walls of defence, a mass of roofs and terraces, where
overtopping all frowned the huge but irregular pile of
Feysul&rsquo;s royal castle, and hard by it rose the scarce less
conspicuous palace, built and inhabited by his eldest son,
&rsquo;Abdallah.&nbsp; Other edifices, too, of remarkable
appearance broke here and there through the maze of gray
roof-tops, but of their object and indwellers we were yet to
learn.&nbsp; All around for full three miles <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>over the
surrounding plain, but more especially to the west and south,
waved a sea of palm-trees above green fields and well-watered
gardens; while the singing, droning sound of the water-wheels
reached us even where we had halted, at a quarter of a mile or
more from the nearest town-walls.&nbsp; On the opposite side
southward, the valley opened out into the great and even more
fertile plains of Yemamah, thickly dotted with groves and
villages, among which the large town of Manfoohah, hardly
inferior in size to Ri&rsquo;ad itself, might be clearly
distinguished.&nbsp; Farther in the background ranged the blue
hills, the ragged Sierra of Yemamah, compared some thirteen
hundred years since, by &rsquo;Amroo-ebn-Kelthoom, the Shomerite,
to drawn swords in battle array; and behind them was concealed
the immeasurable Desert of the South, or Dahna.&nbsp; On the west
the valley closes in and narrows in its upward windings toward
Derey&rsquo;eeyah, while to the southwest the low mounds of Aflaj
are the division between it and Wady Dowasir.&nbsp; Due east in
the distance a long blue line marks the farthest heights of
Toweyk, and shuts out from view the low ground of Hasa and the
shores of the Persian Gulf.&nbsp; In all the countries which I
have visited, and they are many, seldom has it been mine to
survey a landscape equal to this in beauty and in historical
meaning, rich and full alike to eye and mind.&nbsp; But should
any of my readers have ever approached Damascus from the side of
the Anti-Lebanon, and surveyed the Ghootah from the heights above
Mazzeh, they may thence form an approximate idea of the valley of
Ri&rsquo;ad when viewed from the north.&nbsp; Only <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>this is
wider and more varied, and the circle of vision here embraces
vaster plains and bolder mountains; while the mixture of tropical
aridity and luxuriant verdure, of crowded population and desert
tracks, is one that Arabia alone can present, and in comparison
with which Syria seems tame, and Italy monotonous.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Adventures in Ri&rsquo;ad</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Barakat</span> and myself stopped
our dromedaries a few minutes on the height to study and enjoy
this noble prospect, and to forget the anxiety inseparable from a
first approach to the lion&rsquo;s own den.&nbsp;
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa, too, though not unacquainted with the scene,
willingly paused with us to point out and name the main features
of the view, and show us where lay the onward road to his home in
Hasa. We then descended the slope and skirted the walls of the
first outlying plantations which gird the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last we reached a great open square: its right side,
the northern, consists of shops and warehouses; while the left is
entirely absorbed by the huge abode of Nedjean royalty; in front
of us, and consequently to the west, a long covered passage,
upborne high on a clumsy colonnade, crossed the breadth of the
square, and reached from the palace to the great mosque, which it
thus joins directly with the interior of the castle and affords
old Feysul a private and unseen passage at will from his own
apartments to his official post at the Friday prayers, without
exposing him on his way to vulgar curiosity, or perhaps to the
dangers of treachery.&nbsp; For the fate of his father and of his
great-uncle, his predecessors on the throne, and each of them
pierced by the dagger of an assassin <a name="page218"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 218</span>during public worship, has rendered
Feysul very timid on this score, though not at prayer-time
only.&nbsp; Behind this colonnade, other shops and warehouses
make up the end of the square, or, more properly, parallelogram;
its total length is about two hundred paces, by rather more than
half the same width.&nbsp; In the midst of this space, and under
the far-reaching shadow of the castle walls, are seated some
fifty or sixty women, each with a stock of bread, dates, milk,
vegetables, or firewood before her for sale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we did not now stop to gaze, nor indeed did we pay
much attention to all this; our first introduction to the monarch
and the critical position before us took up all our
thoughts.&nbsp; So we paced on alongside of the long blind wall
running out from the central keep, and looking more like the
outside of a fortress than of a peaceful residence, till we came
near a low and narrow gate, the only entry to the palace.&nbsp;
Deep-sunk between the bastions, with massive folding doors iron
bound, though thrown open at this hour of the day, and giving
entrance into a dark passage, one might easily have taken it for
the vestibule of a prison; while the number of guards, some
black, some white, but all sword-girt, who almost choked the way,
did not seem very inviting to those without, especially to
foreigners.&nbsp; Long earth seats lined the adjoining walls, and
afforded a convenient waiting-place for visitors; and here we
took up our rest at a little distance from the palace gate; but
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa entered at once to announce our arrival, and the
approach of the Na&rsquo;ib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first who drew near and saluted us was a <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>tall,
meagre figure, of a sallow complexion, and an intelligent but
slightly ill-natured and underhand cast of features.&nbsp; He was
very well dressed, though of course without a vestige of unlawful
silk in his apparel, and a certain air of conscious importance
tempered the affability of his politeness.&nbsp; This was
&rsquo;Abd-el-&rsquo;Azeez, whom, for want of a better title, I
shall call the minister of foreign affairs, such being the
approximate translation of his official style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accompanied by some attendants from the palace, he came
stately up, and seated himself by our side.&nbsp; He next began
the customary interrogations of whence and what, with much
smiling courtesy and show of welcome.&nbsp; After hearing our
replies, the same of course as those given elsewhere, he invited
us to enter the precincts, and partake of his Majesty&rsquo;s
coffee and hospitality, while he promised us more immediate
communications from the king himself in the course of the
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my readers have seen, as most of them undoubtedly
will, the Paris Tuileries, they may hereby know that the whole
extent of Feysul&rsquo;s palace equals about two-thirds of that
construction, and is little inferior to it in height; if indeed
we except the angular pyramidal roofs or extinguishers peculiar
to the French edifice.&nbsp; But in ornament the Parisian pile
has the better of it, for there is small pretensions to
architectural embellishment in this Wahabee Louvre.&nbsp;
Without, within, every other consideration has been sacrificed to
strength and security; and the outer view of Newgate, at any
rate, bears a very strong resemblance to the general effect of
Feysul&rsquo;s palace.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa meanwhile, in company with the
outriders sent from the palace, had gone to meet the Na&rsquo;ib
and introduce him to the lodgings prepared for his
reception.&nbsp; Very much was the Persian astounded to find none
of the royal family among those who thus came, no one even of
high name or office; but yet more was his surprise when, instead
of immediate admittance to Feysul&rsquo;s presence and eager
embrace, he was quietly led aside to the very guest-room whither
we had been conducted, and a dinner not a whit more sumptuous
than ours was set before him, after which he was very coolly told
that he might pray for Feysul and retire to his quarters, while
the king settled the day and hour whereon he would vouchsafe him
the honor of an audience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterward, the minister of foreign affairs condescended
to come in person, and, sweetly smiling, informed us that our
temporary habitation was ready, and that Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa would
conduct us thither without delay.&nbsp; We then begged to know,
if possible, the king&rsquo;s good-will and pleasure regarding
our stay and our business in the town.&nbsp; For on our first
introduction we had duly stated, in the most correct Wahabee
phraseology, that we had come to Ri&rsquo;ad &lsquo;desiring the
favor of God, and secondly of Feysul; and that we begged of God,
and secondly of Feysul, permission to exercise in the town our
medical profession, under the protection of God, and in the next
place of Feysul.&rsquo;&nbsp; For Dogberry&rsquo;s advice to
&lsquo;set God first, for God defend but God should go before
such villains,&rsquo; is here observed to the letter; whatever is
desired, purported, or asked, the Deity must take the <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>lead.&nbsp;
Nor this only, but even the subsequent mention of the creature
must nowise be coupled with that of the Creator by the ordinary
conjunction &lsquo;w&rsquo;,&rsquo; that is, &lsquo;and,&rsquo;
since that would imply equality between the two&mdash;flat
blasphemy in word or thought.&nbsp; Hence the disjunctive
&lsquo;thumma,&rsquo; or &lsquo;next after,&rsquo; &lsquo;at a
distance,&rsquo; must take the place of &lsquo;w&rsquo;,&rsquo;
under penalty of prosecution under the statute.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Unlucky the man who visits Nedjed without being previously
well versed in the niceties of grammar,&rsquo; said Barakat;
&lsquo;under these schoolmasters a mistake might cost the scholar
his head.&rsquo;&nbsp; But of this more anon; to return to our
subject, &rsquo;Abd-el-&rsquo;Azeez, a true politician, answered
our second interrogation with a vague assurance of good-will and
unmeaning patronage.&nbsp; Meantime the Na&rsquo;ib and his train
marched off in high dudgeon to their quarters, and
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa gave our dromedaries a kick, made them rise, and
drove them before us to our new abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of a day or two the travellers discovered what a
sensation the arrival of their caravan had produced at
court.&nbsp; The old king, Feysul, now in the thirty-third year
of his reign, possessed all the superstition and bigotry of the
old Wahabees, and the sudden presence of Syrians, suspected of
being Christians, Persians, and Meccans, in his capital, was too
much for him.&nbsp; He at once left the palace, took up his
temporary residence in a house outside the city, and a strong
guard was posted around him until the court officials should have
time to examine the strangers, discover, if possible, their
secret designs, and report them to the king.&nbsp; The first spy
was a <a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>shrewd and intelligent Affghan, a pretended convert to
the Wahabee doctrine, who discovered nothing, and consequently
made an unfavorable report.&nbsp; The second was a &ldquo;man of
zeal,&rdquo; one of a committee of twenty-two inquisitors,
appointed by the king to exercise constant espionage upon the
inhabitants, with the power of punishing them at will for any
infraction or neglect of the Wahabee discipline.&nbsp; Palgrave
gives the following account of his visit:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abbood, for such was his name, though I never met the
like before or after in Arabia proper, however common it may be
in Syria and Lebanon, took a different and more efficacious mode
of espionage than &rsquo;Abd-el-Hameed had done before him.&nbsp;
Affecting to consider us Mahometans, and learned ones too, he
entered at once on religious topics, on the true character of
Islam, its purity or corruptions, and inquired much after the
present teaching and usages of Damascus and the North, evidently
in the view of catching us in our words.&nbsp; But he had luckily
encountered his match; for every citation of the Koran we replied
with two, and proved ourselves intimately acquainted with the
&lsquo;greater&rsquo; and the &lsquo;lesser&rsquo; polytheism of
foreign nations and heterodox Mahometans, with the commentaries
of Beydowee and the tales of the Hadeeth, till our visitor, now
won over to confidence, launched out full sail on the sea of
discussion, and thereby rendered himself equally instructive and
interesting to men who had nothing more at heart than to learn
the tenets of the sect from one of its most zealous professors,
nay, a Zelator in person.&nbsp; In short, he ended by becoming
half a friend, and his <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>regrets at our being, like other
Damascenes, yet in the outer porch of darkness, were tempered by
a hope, which he did not disguise, of at least putting a window
in our porch for its better enlightenment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day, in the forenoon, while the travellers were
sauntering about the market-place, they met the minister
&rsquo;Abd-el-&rsquo;Azeez, who had that morning returned to the
capital.&nbsp; With a smiling face and an air of great benignity
he took them aside, and informed them the king did not consider
Ri&rsquo;ad a proper field for their medical skill; that they had
better at once continue their journey to Hofhoof, whither
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa should conduct them straightway; and that the
king would furnish each of them with a camel, a new suit of
clothes, and some money.&nbsp; To these arguments Palgrave could
only answer that he greatly desired the profit to be expected
from a few weeks of medical practice in Ri&rsquo;ad, since his
success there would give him an immediate reputation in Hofhoof,
while his departure might deprive him of all reputation at the
latter place.&nbsp; The minister promised to present his plea to
Feysul, but gave him no hope of a favorable answer.&nbsp; The
order to leave was repeated, and then, as a last experiment,
Palgrave sent to two of the ministers a pound of the fragrant
wood, which is burned as pastilles in Arabia, and is highly
prized by the upper classes.&nbsp; The next day he received
permission to remain longer in Ri&rsquo;ad and exercise his
profession.&nbsp; He thereupon took another residence, not so
near the palace, and within convenient reach of one of the city
gates.&nbsp; <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>Before describing the place he gives the following
account of the famous Arabian coffee:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it then known, by way of prelude, that coffee,
though one in name, is manifold in fact; nor is every kind of
berry entitled to the high qualifications too indiscriminately
bestowed on the comprehensive genus.&nbsp; The best coffee, let
cavillers say what they will, is that of the Yemen, commonly
entitled &lsquo;Mokha,&rsquo; from the main place of
exportation.&nbsp; Now, I should be sorry to incur a lawsuit for
libel or defamation from our wholesale or retail salesmen; but
were the particle <span class="GutSmall">NOT</span> prefixed to
the countless labels in London shop windows that bear the name of
the Red Sea haven, they would have a more truthy import than what
at present they convey.&nbsp; Very little, so little indeed as to
be quite inappreciable, of the Mocha or Yemen berry ever finds
its way westward of Constantinople.&nbsp; Arabia itself, Syria,
and Egypt consume fully two-thirds, and the remainder is almost
exclusively absorbed by Turkish and Armenian
&oelig;sophagi.&nbsp; Nor do these last get for their limited
share the best or the purest.&nbsp; Before reaching the harbors
of Alexandria, Jaffa, Beyrout, etc., for further exportation, the
Mokhan bales have been, while yet on their way, sifted and
resifted, grain by grain, and whatever they may have contained of
the hard, rounded, half-transparent, greenish-brown berry, the
only one really worth roasting and pounding, has been carefully
picked out by experienced fingers; and it is the less generous
residue of flattened, opaque, and whitish grains which alone, or
almost alone, goes on board the shipping.&nbsp; So <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>constant is
this selecting process, that a gradation regular as the degrees
on a map may be observed in the quality of Mokha, that is, Yemen,
coffee even within the limits of Arabia itself, in proportion as
one approaches to or recedes from Wadi Nejran and the
neighborhood of Mecca, the first stages of the radiating
mart.&nbsp; I have myself been times out of number an eye-witness
of this sifting; the operation is performed with the utmost
seriousness and scrupulous exactness, reminding me of the
diligence ascribed to American diamond-searchers when
scrutinizing the torrent sands for their minute but precious
treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The berry, thus qualified for foreign use, quits its
native land on three main lines of export&mdash;that of the Red
Sea, that of the inner Hedjaz, and that of Kaseem.&nbsp; The
terminus of the first line is Egypt, of the second Syria, of the
third Nedjed and Shomer.&nbsp; Hence Egypt and Syria are, of all
countries without the frontiers of Arabia, the best supplied with
its specific produce, though under the restrictions already
stated; and through Alexandria or the Syrian seaports,
Constantinople and the North obtain their diminished share.&nbsp;
But this last stage of transport seldom conveys the genuine
article, except by the intervention of private arrangements and
personal friendship or interest.&nbsp; Where mere sale and
traffic are concerned, substitution of an inferior quality, or an
adulteration almost equivalent to substitution, frequently takes
place in the different storehouses of the coast, till whatever
Mokha-marked coffee leaves them for Europe and the West, is often
no more like <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>the real offspring of the Yemen plant than the log-wood
preparations of a London fourth-rate retail wine-seller resemble
the pure libations of an Oporto vineyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second species of coffee, by some preferred to that
of Yemen, but in my poor opinion inferior to it, is the growth of
Abyssinia; its berry is larger, and of a somewhat different and a
less heating flavor.&nbsp; It is, however, an excellent species;
and whenever the rich land that bears it shall be permitted by
man to enjoy the benefits of her natural fertility, it will
probably become an object of extensive cultivation and
commerce.&nbsp; With this stops, at least in European opinion and
taste, the list of coffee, and begins the list of beans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While we were yet in the Djowf I described with
sufficient minuteness how the berry is prepared for actual use;
nor is the process any way varied in Nedjed or other Arab
lands.&nbsp; But in Nedjed an additional spicing of saffron,
cloves, and the like, is still more common; a fact which is
easily explained by the want of what stimulus tobacco affords
elsewhere.&nbsp; A second consequence of non-smoking among the
Arabs is the increased strength of their coffee decoctions in
Nedjed, and the prodigious frequency of their use; to which we
must add the larger &lsquo;finjans,&rsquo; or coffee-cups, here
in fashion.&nbsp; So sure are men, when debarred of one pleasure
or excitement, to make it up by another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palgrave gives the following picturesque description of the
Wahabee capital: &ldquo;We wrap our headgear, like true Arabs,
round our chins, put on our <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>grave-looking black cloaks, take
each a long stick in hand, and thread the narrow streets
intermediate between our house and the market-place at a funeral
pace, and speaking in an undertone.&nbsp; Those whom we meet
salute us, or we salute them; be it known that the lesser number
should always be the first to salute the greater, he who rides
him who walks, he who walks him who stands, the stander the
sitter, and so forth; but never should a man salute a woman;
difference of age or even of rank between men does not enter into
the general rules touching the priority of salutation.&nbsp; If
those whom we have accosted happen to be acquaintances or
patients, or should they belong to the latitudinarian school, our
salutation is duly returned.&nbsp; But if, by ill fortune, they
appertain to the strict and high orthodox party, an under-look
with a half scowl in silence is their only answer to our
greeting.&nbsp; Whereat we smile, Malvolio-like, and pass on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last we reach the market-place; it is full of women
and peasants, selling exactly what we want to buy, besides meat,
firewood, milk, etc.; around are customers, come on errands like
our own.&nbsp; We single out a tempting basket of dates, and
begin haggling with the unbeautiful Phyllis, seated beside her
rural store.&nbsp; We find the price too high.&nbsp; &lsquo;By
him who protects Feysul,&rsquo; answers she, &lsquo;I am the
loser at that price.&rsquo;&nbsp; We insist.&nbsp; &lsquo;By Him
who shall grant Feysul a long life, I cannot bate it,&rsquo; she
replies.&nbsp; We have nothing to oppose to such tremendous
asseverations, and accede or pass on, as the case may be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half of the shops, namely, those containing <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>grocery,
household articles of use, shoemakers&rsquo; stalls and smithies,
are already open and busily thronged.&nbsp; For the capital of a
strongly centralized empire is always full of strangers, come
will they nill they on their several affairs.&nbsp; But around
the butchers&rsquo; shops awaits the greatest human and canine
crowd.&nbsp; My readers, I doubt not, know that the only licensed
scavengers throughout the East are the dogs.&nbsp; Nedjeans are
great flesh-eaters, and no wonder, considering the cheapness of
meat (a fine fat sheep costs at most five shillings, often less)
and the keenness of mountaineer appetites.&nbsp; I wish that the
police regulations of the city would enforce a little more
cleanliness about these numerous shambles; every refuse is left
to cumber the ground at scarce two yards&rsquo; distance.&nbsp;
But dogs and dry air much alleviate the nuisance&mdash;a remark I
made before at Ha&rsquo;yel and Bereydah; it holds true for all
Central Arabia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barakat and I resolve on continuing our walk through
the town.&nbsp; Ri&rsquo;ad is divided into four quarters: one,
the northeastern, to which the palaces of the royal family, the
houses of the state officers, and the richer class of proprietors
and government men belong.&nbsp; Here the dwellings are in
general high, and the streets tolerably straight and not
over-narrow; but the ground level is low, and it is perhaps the
least healthy locality of all.&nbsp; Next the northwestern, where
we are lodged; a large irregular mass of houses, varying in size
and keeping from the best to the worst; here strangers, and often
certain equivocal characters, never wanting in large towns,
however strictly regulated, chiefly abide; here too are <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>many noted
for disaffection, and harboring other tenets than those of the
son of &rsquo;Abdel-Wahab, men prone to old Arab ways and customs
in &lsquo;Church and State,&rsquo; to borrow our own analogous
phrase; here are country chiefs, here Bedouins and natives of
Zulphah and the outskirts find a lodging; here, if anywhere, is
tobacco smoked or sold, and the Koran neglected in
proportion.&nbsp; However, I would not have my readers to think
our entire neighborhood so absolutely disreputable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we gladly turn away our eyes from so dreary a view
to refresh them by a survey of the southwestern quarter, the
chosen abode of formalism and orthodoxy.&nbsp; In this section of
Ri&rsquo;ad inhabit the most energetic Zelators, here are the
most irreproachable five-prayers-a-day Nedjeans, and all the
flower of Wahabee purity.&nbsp; Above all, here dwell the
principal survivors of the family of the great religions Founder,
the posterity of &rsquo;Abd-el-Wahab escaped from the Egyptian
sword, and free from every stain of foreign contamination.&nbsp;
Mosques of primitive simplicity and ample space, where the great
dogma, not however confined to Ri&rsquo;ad, that &lsquo;we are
exactly in the right, and everyone else is in the wrong,&rsquo;
is daily inculcated to crowds of auditors, overjoyed to find
Paradise all theirs and none&rsquo;s but theirs; smaller
oratories of Musallas, wells for ablution, and Kaabah-directed
niches adorn every corner, and fill up every interval of house or
orchard.&nbsp; The streets of this quarter are open, and the air
healthy, so that the invisible blessing is seconded by sensible
and visible privileges of Providence.&nbsp; Think not, gentle
reader, <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>that I am indulging in gratuitous or self-invented
irony; I am only rendering expression for expression, and almost
word for word, the talk of true Wahabees, when describing the
model quarter of their model city.&nbsp; This section of the town
is spacious and well-peopled, and flourishes, the citadel of
national and religious intolerance, pious pride, and genuine
Wahabeeism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Round the whole town run the walls, varying from twenty
to thirty feet in height; they are strong, in good repair, and
defended by a deep trench and embankment.&nbsp; Beyond them are
the gardens, much similar to those of Kaseem, both in arrangement
and produce, despite the difference of latitude, here compensated
by a higher ground level.&nbsp; But immediately to the south, in
Yemamah, the eye remarks a change in the vegetation to a more
tropical aspect; of this, however, I will not say more for the
present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to promise, Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa played his part
to bring us in patients and customers, and the very second
morning that dawned on us in our new house ushered in an invalid
who proved a very godsend.&nbsp; This was no other than Djowhar,
treasurer of Feysul, and of the Wahabee empire.&nbsp; My readers
may be startled to learn that this great functionary was jet
black, a negro in fact, though not a slave, having obtained his
freedom from Turkee, the father of the present king.&nbsp; He was
tall, and, for a negro, handsome; about forty-five years of age,
splendidly dressed, a point never neglected by wealthy Africans,
whatever be their theoretical creed, and girt with a
golden-hilted sword.&nbsp; &lsquo;But,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;gold, though <a name="page231"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 231</span>unlawful if forming a part of
apparel or mere ornament, may be employed with a safe conscience
in decorating weapons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After ceremonies and coffee, I took my dusky patient
into the consulting-room, where, by dint of questioning and
surmise, for negroes in general are much less clear and less to
the point than Arabs in their statements, I obtained the
requisite elucidation of his case.&nbsp; The malady, though
painful, was fortunately one admitting of simple and efficacious
treatment, so that I was able on the spot to promise him a
sensible amendment of condition within a fortnight, and that in
three weeks&rsquo; time he should be in plight to undertake his
journey to Bahreyn.&nbsp; I added that with so distinguished a
personage I could not think of exacting a bargain and fixing the
amount of fees; the requital of my care should be left to his
generosity.&nbsp; He then took leave, and was re-conducted to his
rooms in the palace by his fellow blacks of less
degree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next visitor was Abd el-Kereem, of the oldest nobility of
Nedjed, related to the ruling family; a bitter Wahabee, a strong,
intelligent, bad, and dangerous man, who was both hated and
feared by the people.&nbsp; His visit was a distinction for
Palgrave, yet an additional danger.&nbsp; The latter, however,
determined to draw as much information from him concerning
Wahabee doctrine as he might be inclined to give; and, in
reality, found him quite communicative.&nbsp; One day Palgrave
asked him to define the difference between the <i>great</i> sins
and the <i>little</i> ones&mdash;that is, those to be punished in
the next world, or <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>at least deserving of it, and those whose penalty is
remissible in this life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Abd-el-Kereem doubted not that he had a sincere scholar
before him, nor would refuse his hand to a drowning man.&nbsp;
So, putting on a profound air, and with a voice of first-class
solemnity, he uttered his oracle, that &lsquo;the first of the
great sins is the giving divine honors to a
creature.&rsquo;&nbsp; A hit, I may observe, at ordinary
Mahometans, whose whole doctrine of intercession, whether vested
in Mahomet or in &rsquo;Alee, is classed by Wahabees along with
direct and downright idolatry.&nbsp; A Damascene Shekh would have
avoided the equivocation by answering,
&lsquo;infidelity.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; I replied, &lsquo;the enormity
of such a sin is beyond all doubt.&nbsp; But if this be the
first, there must be a second; what is it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drinking the shameful,&rsquo; in English,
&lsquo;smoking tobacco,&rsquo; was the unhesitating answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And murder, and adultery, and false
witness?&rsquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;God is merciful and forgiving,&rsquo; rejoined
my friend; that is, these are merely little sins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hence two sins alone are great, polytheism and
smoking,&rsquo; I continued, though hardly able to keep
countenance any longer.&nbsp; And Abd-el-Kereem, with the most
serious asseveration, replied that such was really the
case.&nbsp; On hearing this, I proceeded humbly to entreat my
friend to explain to me the especial wickedness inherent in
tobacco leaves, that I might the more detest and eschew them
hereafter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly he proceeded to instruct me, <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>saying
that, Firstly, all intoxicating substances are prohibited by the
Koran; but tobacco is an intoxicating substance&mdash;ergo,
tobacco is prohibited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I insinuated that it was not intoxicating, and appealed
to experience.&nbsp; But, to my surprise, my friend had
experience too on his side, and had ready at hand the most
appalling tales of men falling down dead drunk after a single
whiff of smoke, and of others in a state of bestial and habitual
ebriety from its use.&nbsp; Nor were his stories so purely
gratuitous as many might at first imagine.&nbsp; The only tobacco
known, when known, in Southern Nedjed, is that of Oman, a very
powerful species.&nbsp; I was myself astonished, and almost
&lsquo;taken in,&rsquo; more than once, by its extraordinary
narcotic effects, when I experienced them, in the coffee-houses
of Bahreyn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Palgrave furnishes a tolerably complete account of the
provinces of Nedjed and the tribes which inhabit them.&nbsp; His
concluding statement, however, embodies all which will interest
the reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To sum up, we may say that the Wahabee empire is a
compact and well-organized government, where centralization is
fully understood and effectually carried out, and whose
main-springs and connecting links are force and fanaticism.&nbsp;
There exist no constitutional checks either on the king or on his
subordinates, save what the necessity of circumstance imposes or
the Koran prescribes.&nbsp; Its atmosphere, to speak
metaphorically, is sheer despotism&mdash;moral, intellectual,
religious, and physical.&nbsp; This empire is capable of frontier
extension, and hence is dangerous to its neighbors, some of whom
it is even now <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>swallowing up, and will certainly swallow more if not
otherwise prevented.&nbsp; Incapable of true internal progress,
hostile to commerce, unfavorable to arts and even to agriculture,
and in the highest degree intolerant and aggressive, it can
neither better itself nor benefit others; while the order and
calm which it sometimes spreads over the lands of its conquest
are described in the oft-cited <i>Ubi solitudinem faciunt pacem
appellant</i> of the Roman annalist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In conclusion, I here subjoin a numerical list, taken
partly from the government registers of Ri&rsquo;ad, partly from
local information, and containing the provinces, the number of
the principal towns or villages, the population, and the military
contingent, throughout the Wahabee empire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a time, Palgrave was sent for by Abdallah, the eldest
son of King Feysul, who pretended that he wished to learn
something of the medical art.&nbsp; This led to a regular
intercourse, which at least enabled the traveller to learn many
things concerning the Wahabee government.&nbsp; Another important
<a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>result
was an opportunity of visiting the royal stables, where the
finest specimens of the famous Nedjed breed of horses are
kept.&nbsp; Of these he gives the following interesting
description:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stables are situated some way out of the town, to
the northeast, a little to the left of the road which we had
followed at our first arrival, and not far from the gardens of
&rsquo;Abd-er-Rahman the Wahabee.&nbsp; They cover a large square
space, about 150 yards each way, and are open in the centre, with
a long shed running round the inner walls; under this covering
the horses, about three hundred in number when I saw them, are
picketed during the night; in the daytime they may stretch their
legs at pleasure within the central court-yard.&nbsp; The greater
number were accordingly loose; a few, however, were tied up at
their stalls; some, but not many, had horse-cloths over
them.&nbsp; The heavy dews which fall in Wady Haneefah do not
permit their remaining with impunity in the open night air; I was
told also that a northerly wind will occasionally injure the
animals here, no less than the land wind does now and then their
brethren in India.&nbsp; About half the royal stud was present
before me, the rest were out at grass; Feysul&rsquo;s entire
muster is reckoned at six hundred, or rather more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Arab dreams of tying up a horse by the neck; a
tether replaces the halter, and one of the animal&rsquo;s hind
legs is encircled about the pastern by a light iron ring,
furnished with a padlock, and connected with an iron chain of two
feet or thereabouts in length, ending in a rope, which is
fastened to the <a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
236</span>ground at some distance by an iron peg; such is the
customary method.&nbsp; But should the animal be restless and
troublesome, a foreleg is put under similar restraint.&nbsp; It
is well known that in Arabia horses are much less frequently
vicious or refractory than in Europe, and this is the reason why
geldings are here so rare, though not unknown.&nbsp; No
particular prejudice, that I could discover, exists against the
operation itself; only it is seldom performed, because not
otherwise necessary, and tending, of course, to diminish the
value of the animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to return to the horses now before us; never had I
seen or imagined so lovely a collection.&nbsp; Their stature was
indeed somewhat low; I do not think that any came fully up to
fifteen hands; fourteen appeared to me about their average, but
they were so exquisitely well shaped that want of greater size
seemed hardly, if at all, a defect.&nbsp; Remarkably full in the
haunches, with a shoulder of a slope so elegant as to make one,
in the words of an Arab poet, &lsquo;go raving mad about
it;&rsquo; a little, a very little, saddle-backed, just the curve
which indicates springiness without any weakness; a head broad
above, and tapering down to a nose fine enough to verify the
phrase of &lsquo;drinking from a pint pot,&rsquo; did pint pots
exist in Nedjed; a most intelligent and yet a singularly gentle
look, full eye, sharp thorn-like little ear, legs fore and hind
that seemed as if made of hammered iron, so clean and yet so well
twisted with sinew; a neat, round hoof, just the requisite for
hard ground; the tail set on, or rather thrown out at a perfect
arch; coats smooth, shining, and light, the <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>mane long,
but not overgrown nor heavy, and an air and step that seemed to
say, &lsquo;Look at me, am I not pretty?&rsquo; their appearance
justified all reputation, all value, all poetry.&nbsp; The
prevailing color was chestnut or gray; a light bay, an iron
color, white or black, were less common; full bay, flea-bitten or
piebald, none.&nbsp; But if asked what are, after all, the
specially distinctive points of the Nedjee horse, I should reply,
the slope of the shoulder, the extreme cleanness of the shank,
and the full, rounded haunch, though every other part, too, has a
perfection and a harmony unwitnessed (at least by my eyes)
anywhere else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nedjee horses are especially esteemed for great speed
and endurance of fatigue; indeed, in this latter quality, none
come up to them.&nbsp; To pass twenty-four hours on the road
without drink and without flagging is certainly something; but to
keep up the same abstinence and labor conjoined under the burning
Arabian sky for forty-eight hours at a stretch, is, I believe,
peculiar to the animals of the breed.&nbsp; Besides, they have a
delicacy, I cannot say of mouth, for it is common to ride them
without bit or bridle, but of feeling and obedience to the knee
and thigh, to the slightest check of the halter and the voice of
the rider, far surpassing whatever the most elaborate
man&eacute;ge gives a European horse, though furnished with
snaffle, curb, and all.&nbsp; I often mounted them at the
invitation of their owners, and without saddle, rein, or stirrup,
set them off at full gallop, wheeled them round, brought them up
in mid career at a dead halt, and that without the least
difficulty or the smallest want of correspondence between the
horse&rsquo;s <a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>movements and my own will; the rider on their back
really feels himself the man-half of a centaur, not a distinct
being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the last week in November the Persian Na&rsquo;ib, who
had been little edified by his experiences in Nedjed, set off for
Bagdad.&nbsp; In the meantime, Feysul had made great preparations
toward collecting an army for the reduction of the city of
&rsquo;Oneyzah (near Bereydah), which still held out
gallantly.&nbsp; Troops were summoned from the eastern coast and
the adjoining provinces, and Sa&rsquo;ood, the second son of
Feysul, was ordered to bring them together at the capital, when
the command was to be given to Abdallah, the eldest son.&nbsp;
Palgrave had then his only opportunity of seeing the old King of
the Wahabees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sa&rsquo;ood speedily arrived, and with him about two
hundred horsemen; the rest of his men, more than two thousand,
were mounted on camels.&nbsp; When they entered Ri&rsquo;ad,
Feysul, for the first and last time during our stay, gave a
public audience at the palace gate.&nbsp; It was a scene for a
painter.&nbsp; There sat the blind old tyrant, corpulent,
decrepit, yet imposing, with his large, broad forehead, white
beard, and thoughtful air, clad in all the simplicity of a
Wahabee; the gold-hafted sword at his side his only ornament or
distinction.&nbsp; Beside him the ministers, the officers of his
court, and a crowd of the nobler and wealthier citizens.&nbsp;
Abdallah, the heir to the throne, was alone absent.&nbsp; Up came
Sa&rsquo;ood with the bearing of a hussar officer, richly clad in
cashmere shawls and a gold-wrought mantle, while man by man
followed his red-dressed cavaliers, their spears <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>over their
shoulders, and their swords hanging down; a musket, too, was
slung behind the saddle of each warrior; and the sharp dagger of
Hareek glittered in every girdle.&nbsp; Next came the common
soldiers on camels or dromedaries, some with spears only, some
with spears and guns, till the wide square was filled with armed
men and gazing spectators, as the whole troop drew up before the
great autocrat, and Sa&rsquo;ood alighted to bend and kiss his
father&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;God save Feysul!&nbsp; God give
the victory to the armies of the Muslims!&rsquo; was shouted out
on every side, and all faces kindled into the fierce smile of
concentrated enthusiasm and conscious strength.&nbsp; Feysul
arose from his seat and placed his son at his side; another
moment, and they entered the castle together.&rdquo;</p>

Travels&mdash;His Escape to the Eastern Coast</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">For</span> a foreigner to enter
Ri&rsquo;ad is not always easy, but to get away from it is harder
still; Reynard himself would have been justly shy of venturing on
this royal cave.&nbsp; There exists in the capital of Nedjed two
approved means of barring the exit against those on whom mistrust
may have fallen.&nbsp; The first and readiest is that of which it
has been emphatically said, <i>Stone-dead hath no
fellow</i>.&nbsp; But should circumstances render the bonds of
death inexpedient, the bonds of Hymen and a Ri&rsquo;ad
establishment may and occasionally do supply their office.&nbsp;
By this latter proceeding, the more amiable of the two, Abdallah
resolved to enchain us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accordingly, one morning arrived at our dwelling an
attendant of the palace, with a smiling face, presage of some
good in reserve, and many fair speeches.&nbsp; After inquiries
about our health, comfort, well-being, etc., he added that
Abdallah thought we might be desirous of purchasing this or that,
and begged us to accept of a small present.&nbsp; It was a fair
sum of money, just twice so much as the ordinary token of
good-will, namely, four rials in place of two.&nbsp; After which
the messenger took his leave.&nbsp; <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa had been present at
the interview: &lsquo;Be on the look-out,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;there is something wrong.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That very afternoon Abdallah sent for me, and with
abundance of encomiums and of promises, declared that he could
not think of letting Ri&rsquo;ad lose so valuable a physician,
that I must accordingly take up a permanent abode in the capital,
where I might rely on his patronage, and on all good things; that
he had already resolved on giving me a house and a garden,
specifying them, with a suitable household, and a fair face to
keep me company; he concluded by inviting me to go without delay
and see whether the new abode fitted me, and take possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much and long did I fight off; talked about a winter
visit to the coast, and coming back in the spring; tried first
one pretext and then another; but none would avail, and Abdallah
continued to insist.&nbsp; To quiet him, I consented to go and
see the house.&nbsp; For the intended Calypso, I had ready an
argument derived from Mahometan law, which put her out of the
question, but its explanation would require more space than these
pages can afford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The winter season was now setting in; it was the third
week in November; and a thunder-storm, the first we had witnessed
in Central Arabia, ushered in a marked change for cold in the
temperature of Wady Haneefah.&nbsp; Rain fell abundantly, and
sent torrents down the dry watercourses of the valley, changing
its large hollows into temporary tanks.&nbsp; None of the streams
showed, however, any disposition to reach the sea, nor indeed
could they, for this part of Nedjed is entirely hemmed in to the
east by <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>the Toweyk range.&nbsp; The inhabitants welcomed the
copious showers, pledges of fertility for the coming year, while
at &rsquo;Oneyzah the same rains produced at least one excellent
effect, but which I may well defy my readers to guess.&nbsp; The
hostile armies, commanded by Zamil and Mohammed-ebn-Sa&rsquo;ood,
were drawn up in face of each other, and on the point of fierce
conflict, when the storm burst on them, and by putting out the
lighted matchlocks of either party, prevented the discharge of
bullets and the effusion of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abdallah, who hated his second brother, Sa&rsquo;ood, and had
many other fierce enmities in the capital, then accidentally
learned that Palgrave had employed a deadly poison (strychnine)
in making a remarkable cure.&nbsp; Thenceforth all his powers of
persuasion were employed in endeavoring to procure some of the
drug; but Palgrave, suspecting his real design, positively
refused to let him have any.&nbsp; His rage was suddenly and
strongly expressed on his countenance, foreboding no good to the
traveller, who took the first opportunity of returning to his
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa, Barakat, and myself,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;immediately held council to consider what was now to
be done.&nbsp; That an outbreak must shortly take place seemed
certain; to await it was dangerous, yet we could not safely leave
the town in an over-precipitate manner, nor without some kind of
permission.&nbsp; We resolved together to go on in quiet and
caution a few days more, to sound the court, make our adieus at
Feysul&rsquo;s palace, get a good word from Mahboob (no difficult
matter), and then slip off <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>without attracting too much
notice.&nbsp; But our destiny was not to run so
smoothly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Late in the evening of November 21st, Palgrave was summoned to
Abdallah&rsquo;s palace.&nbsp; The messenger refused to allow
Barakat or Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa to accompany him.&nbsp; The occasion
seemed portentous, but disobedience was out of the
question.&nbsp; Palgrave followed the messenger.&nbsp; On
entering the reception-room, he found Abdallah, Abd-el-Lateef,
the successor of the Wahabee, Mahboob, and a few others.&nbsp;
All were silent, and none returned his first salutation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I saluted Abdallah,&rdquo; says Palgrave, &ldquo;who
replied in an undertone, and gave me a signal to sit down at a
little distance from him, but on the same side of the
divan.&nbsp; My readers may suppose that I was not at the moment
ambitious of too intimate a vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After an interval of silence, Abdallah turned half
round toward me, and with his blackest look and a deep voice
said, &lsquo;I now know perfectly well what you are; you are no
doctors, you are Christians, spies, and revolutionists, come
hither to ruin our religion and state in behalf of those who sent
you.&nbsp; The penalty for such as you is death, that you know,
and I am determined to inflict it without delay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Threatened folks live long,&rsquo; thought I,
and had no difficulty in showing the calm which I really
felt.&nbsp; So looking him coolly in the face, I replied,
&lsquo;<i>Istagh-fir Allah</i>,&rsquo; literally, &lsquo;Ask
pardon of God.&rsquo;&nbsp; This is the phrase commonly addressed
to one who has said something extremely out of place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The answer was unexpected: he started, and said,
&lsquo;Why so?&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; I rejoined, &lsquo;you
have just now uttered a sheer absurdity.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Christians,&rdquo; be it so; but &ldquo;spies,&rdquo;
&ldquo;revolutionists&rdquo;&mdash;as if we were not known by
everybody in your town for quiet doctors, neither more nor
less!&nbsp; And then to talk about putting me to death!&nbsp; You
cannot, and you dare not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I can and dare,&rsquo; answered Abdallah,
&lsquo;and who shall prevent me?&nbsp; You shall soon learn that
to your cost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither can nor dare,&rsquo; repeated I.&nbsp;
&lsquo;We are here your father&rsquo;s guests, and yours for a
month and more, known as such, received as such.&nbsp; What have
we done to justify a breach of the laws of hospitality in
Nedjed?&nbsp; It is impossible for you to do what you say,&rsquo;
continued I, thinking the while that it was a great deal too
possible, after all; &lsquo;the obloquy of the deed would be too
much for you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He remained a moment thoughtful, then said, &lsquo;As
if anyone need know who did it.&nbsp; I have the means, and can
dispose of you without talk or rumor.&nbsp; Those who are at my
bidding can take a suitable time and place for that, without my
name being ever mentioned in the affair.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The advantage was now evidently on my side; I followed
it up, and said with a quiet laugh, &lsquo;Neither is that within
your power.&nbsp; Am I not known to your father, to all in his
palace? to your own brother Sa&rsquo;ood among the rest?&nbsp; Is
not the fact of this my actual visit to you known without your
gates?&nbsp; Or is there no one here?&rsquo; added I, with a
glance at Mahboob, &lsquo;who can report elsewhere what you have
just now said?&nbsp; Better for you to leave off this <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>nonsense;
do you take me for a child of four days old?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He muttered a repetition of his threat.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Bear witness, all here present,&rsquo; said I, raising my
voice so as to be heard from one end of the room to the other,
&lsquo;that if any mishap befalls my companion or myself from
Ri&rsquo;ad to the shores of the Persian Gulf, it is all
Abdallah&rsquo;s doing.&nbsp; And the consequences shall be on
his head, worse consequences than he expects or
dreams.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prince made no reply.&nbsp; All were silent;
Mahboob kept his eyes steadily fixed on the fireplace;
&rsquo;Abd-el-Lateef looked much and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bring coffee,&rsquo; called out Abdallah to the
servants.&nbsp; Before a minute had elapsed, a black slave
approached with one, and only one, coffee-cup in his hand.&nbsp;
At a second sign from his master he came before me and presented
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course the worst might be conjectured of so unusual
and solitary a draught.&nbsp; But I thought it highly improbable
that matters should have been so accurately prepared; besides,
his main cause of anger was precisely the refusal of poisons, a
fact which implied that he had none by him ready for use.&nbsp;
So I said &lsquo;<i>Bismillah</i>,&rsquo; took the cup, looked
very hard at Abdallah, drank it off, and then said to the slave,
&lsquo;Pour me out a second.&rsquo;&nbsp; This he did; I
swallowed it, and said, &lsquo;Now you may take the cup
away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The desired effect was fully attained.&nbsp;
Abdallah&rsquo;s face announced defeat, while the rest of the
assembly whispered together.&nbsp; The prince turned to
&rsquo;Abd-el-Lateef and began talking about the dangers <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>to which
the land was exposed from spies, and the wicked designs of
infidels for ruining the kingdom of the Muslims.&nbsp; The Kadee
and his companions chimed in, and the story of a pseudo-Darweesh
traveller killed at Derey&rsquo;eeyah, and of another (but who he
was I cannot fancy; perhaps a Persian, who had, said Abdallah,
been also recognized for an intriguer, but had escaped to Muscat,
and thus baffled the penalty due to his crimes), were now brought
forward and commented on.&nbsp; Mahboob now at last spoke, but it
was to ridicule such apprehensions.&nbsp; &lsquo;The thing is in
itself unlikely,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and were it so, what harm
could they do?&rsquo; alluding to my companion and myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this I took up the word, and a general conversation
ensued, in which I did my best to explode the idea of spies and
spymanship, appealed to our own quiet and inoffensive conduct,
got into a virtuous indignation against such a requital of evil
for good after all the services which we had rendered court and
town, and quoted verses of the Koran regarding the wickedness of
ungrounded suspicion, and the obligation of not judging ill
without clear evidence.&nbsp; Abdallah made no direct answer, and
the others, whatever they may have thought, could not support a
charge abandoned by their master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What amused me not a little was that the Wahabee prince
had after all very nearly hit the right nail on the head, and
that I was snubbing him only for having guessed too well.&nbsp;
But there was no help for it, and I had the pleasure of seeing
that, though at heart unchanged in his opinion about us, he was
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>yet
sufficiently cowed to render a respite certain, and our escape
thereby practicable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This kind of talk continued a while, and I purposely
kept my seat, to show the unconcern of innocence, till Mahboob
made me a sign that I might safely retire.&nbsp; On this I took
leave of Abdallah and quitted the palace unaccompanied.&nbsp; It
was now near midnight, not a light to be seen in the houses, not
a sound to be heard in the streets; the sky too was dark and
overcast, till, for the first time, a feeling of lonely dread
came over me, and I confess that more than once I turned my head
to look and see if no one was following with &lsquo;evil,&rsquo;
as Arabs say, in his hand.&nbsp; But there was none, and I
reached the quiet alley and low door where a gleam through the
chinks announced the anxious watch of my companions, who now
opened the entrance, overjoyed at seeing me back sound and safe
from so critical a parley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our plan for the future was soon formed.&nbsp; A day or
two we were yet to remain in Ri&rsquo;ad, lest haste should seem
to imply fear, and thereby encourage pursuit.&nbsp; But during
that period we would avoid the palace, out-walks in gardens or
after nightfall, and keep at home as much as possible.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa was to get his dromedaries ready, and
put them in a courtyard immediately adjoining the house, to be
laden at a moment&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A band of travellers was to leave Ri&rsquo;ad for Hasa
a few days later.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa gave out publicly that
he would accompany them to Hofhoof, while we were supposed to
intend following the northern or Sedeyr track, by which the
Na&rsquo;ib, after many <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>reciprocal farewells and assurances
of lasting friendship, should we ever meet again, had lately
departed.&nbsp; Mobeyreek, a black servant in
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa&rsquo;s pay, occupied himself diligently in
feeding up the camels for their long march with clover and
vetches, both abundant here; and we continued our medical
avocations, but quietly, and without much leaving the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the afternoon of the 24th we brought three of
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa&rsquo;s camels into our courtyard, shut the
outer door, packed, and laded.&nbsp; We then awaited the moment
of evening prayer; it came, and the voice of the
Mu&rsquo;eddineen summoned all good Wahabees, the men of the
town-guard not excepted, to the different mosques.&nbsp; When
about ten minutes had gone by, and all might be supposed at their
prayers, we opened our door.&nbsp; Mobeyreek gave a glance up and
down the street to ascertain that no one was in sight, and we led
out the camels.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa accompanied us.&nbsp;
Avoiding the larger thoroughfares, we took our way by by-lanes
and side-passages toward a small town-gate, the nearest to our
house, and opening on the north.&nbsp; A late comer fell in with
us on his way to the Mesjid, and as he passed summoned us also to
the public service.&nbsp; But Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa unhesitatingly
replied, &lsquo;We have this moment come from prayers,&rsquo; and
our interlocutor, fearing to be himself too late and thus to fall
under reprehension and punishment, rushed off to the nearest
oratory, leaving the road clear.&nbsp; Nobody was in watch at the
gate.&nbsp; We crossed its threshold, turned southeast, and under
the rapid twilight reached a range of small hillocks, behind
which we sheltered ourselves till the stars came <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>out, and
the &lsquo;wing of night,&rsquo; to quote Arab poets, spread
black over town and country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far so good.&nbsp; But further difficulties remained
before us.&nbsp; It was now more than ever absolutely essential
to get clear of Nedjed unobserved, to put the desert between us
and the Wahabee court and capital; and no less necessary was it
that Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa, so closely connected as he was with
Ri&rsquo;ad and its government, should seem nohow implicated in
our unceremonious departure, nor any way concerned with our
onward movements.&nbsp; In a word, an apparent separation of
paths between him and us was necessary before we could again come
together and complete the remainder of our explorations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In order to manage this, and while ensuring our own
safety to throw a little dust in Wahabee eyes, it was agreed that
before next morning&rsquo;s sunrise Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa should
return to the town, and to his dwelling, as though nothing had
occurred, and should there await the departure of the great
merchant caravan, mentioned previously, and composed mainly of
men from Hasa and Kateef, now bound for Hofhoof.&nbsp; This
assemblage was expected to start within three days at
latest.&nbsp; Meanwhile our friend should take care to show
himself openly in the palaces of Feysul and Abdallah, and if
asked about us should answer vaguely, with the off-hand air of
one who had no further care regarding us.&nbsp; We ourselves
should in the interim make the best of our way, with Mobeyreek
for guide, to Wady Soley&rsquo;, and there remain concealed in a
given spot, till Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa should come and pick us up.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
250</span>&ldquo;All this was arranged; at break of dawn,
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa took his leave, and Barakat, Mobeyreek, and
myself were once more high-perched on our dromedaries, their
heads turned to the southeast, keeping the hillock range between
us and Ri&rsquo;ad, which we saw no more.&nbsp; Our path led us
over low undulating ground, a continuation of Wady Haneefah, till
after about four hours&rsquo; march we were before the gates of
Manfoohah, a considerable town, surrounded by gardens nothing
inferior in extent and fertility to those of Ri&rsquo;ad; but its
fortifications, once strong, have long since been dismantled and
broken down by the jealousy of the neighboring capital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After winding here and there, we reached the spot
assigned by Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa for our hiding-place.&nbsp; It was a
small sandy depth, lying some way off the beaten track, amid
hillocks and brushwood, and without water; of this latter article
we had taken enough in the goat-skins to last us for three
days.&nbsp; Here we halted, and made up our minds to patience and
expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days passed drearily enough.&nbsp; We could not but
long for our guide&rsquo;s arrival, nor be wholly without fear on
more than one score.&nbsp; Once or twice a stray peasant stumbled
on us, and was much surprised at our encampment in so droughty a
locality.&nbsp; So the hours went by, till the third day brought
closer expectation and anxiety, still increasing while the sun
declined, and at last went down; yet nobody appeared.&nbsp; But
just as darkness closed in, and we were sitting in a dispirited
group beside our little fire, for the night air blew chill,
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa came suddenly <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>up, and all was changed for question
and answer, for cheerfulness and laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early on November 28th we resumed our march through a
light valley-mist, and soon fell in with our companions of the
road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning the whole country, hill and dale, trees
and bushes, was wrapped in a thick blanket of mist, fitter for
Surrey than for Arabia.&nbsp; So dense was the milky fog, that we
fairly lost our way, and went on at random, shouting and
hallooing, driving our beasts now here, now there, over broken
ground and amid tangling shrubs, till the sun gained strength and
the vapor cleared off, showing us the path at some distance on
our right.&nbsp; Before we had followed it far, we saw a black
mass advancing from the east to meet us.&nbsp; It was the first
division of the Hasa troops on their way to Ri&rsquo;ad; they
were not less than four or five hundred in number.&nbsp; Like
true Arabs, they marched with a noble contempt of order and
discipline&mdash;walking, galloping, ambling, singing, shouting,
alone or in bands, as fancy led.&nbsp; We interchanged a few
words of greeting with these brisk boys, who avowed, without
hesitation or shame, that they should much have preferred to stay
at home, and that enforced necessity, not any military or
religious ardor, was taking them to the field.&nbsp; We laughed,
and wished them Zamil&rsquo;s head, or him theirs, whereon they
laughed also, shouted, and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On we went, but through a country of much more varied
scenery than what we had traversed the day before, enjoying the
&lsquo;pleasure situate in hill and <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>dale,&rsquo; till we arrived at the
foot of a high white cliff, almost like that of Dover; but these
crags, instead of having the sea at their foot, overlooked a wide
valley full of trees, and bearing traces of many violent winter
torrents from east to west; none were now flowing.&nbsp; Here we
halted, and passed an indifferent night, much annoyed by
&lsquo;chill November&rsquo;s surly blast,&rsquo; hardly less
ungenial here than on the banks of Ayr, though sweeping over a
latitude of 25&deg;, not 56&deg;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the starlight had faded from the cold morning
sky, we were up and in movement, for a long march was before
us.&nbsp; At sunrise we stood on the last, and here the highest,
ledge of Toweyk, that long chalky wall which bounds and backs up
Nedjed on the east; beyond is the desert, and then the coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After about three hours of level route we began to
descend, not rapidly, but by degrees, and at noon we reached a
singular depression, a huge natural basin, hollowed out in the
limestone rock, with tracks resembling deep trenches leading to
it from every side.&nbsp; At the bottom of this crater-like
valley were a dozen or more wells, so abundant in their supply
that they not unfrequently overflow the whole space, and form a
small lake; the water is clear and good, but no other is to be
met with on the entire line hence to Hasa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the rest of the day we continued steadily to
descend the broad even slope, whose extreme barrenness and
inanimate monotony reminded me of the pebbly uplands near
Ma&rsquo;an on the opposite side of <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>the peninsula, traversed by us
exactly seven months before.&nbsp; The sun set, night came on,
and many of the travellers would gladly have halted, but
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa insisted on continuing the march.&nbsp; We were
now many hundred feet lower than the crest behind us, and the air
felt warm and heavy, when we noticed that the ground, hitherto
hard beneath our feet, was changing step by step into a light
sand, that seemed to encroach on the rocky soil.&nbsp; It was at
first a shallow ripple, then deepened, and before long presented
the well-known ridges and undulations characteristic of the land
ocean when several fathoms in depth.&nbsp; Our beasts ploughed
laboriously on through the yielding surface; the night was dark,
but starry, and we could just discern amid the shade a white
glimmer of spectral sand-hills, rising around us on every side,
but no track or indication of a route.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the great Dahna, or &lsquo;Red Desert,&rsquo;
the bugbear of even the wandering Bedouin, and never traversed by
ordinary wayfarers without an apprehension which has too often
been justified by fatal incidents.&nbsp; So light are the sands,
so capricious the breezes that shape and reshape them daily into
unstable hills and valleys, that no traces of preceding
travellers remain to those who follow; while intense heat and
glaring light reflected on all sides combine with drought and
weariness to confuse and bewilder the adventurer, till he loses
his compass and wanders up and down at random amid a waste
solitude which soon becomes his grave.&nbsp; Many have thus
perished; even whole caravans have been known to disappear <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>in the
Dahna without a vestige, till the wild Arab tales of demons
carrying off wanderers, or ghouls devouring them, obtain a half
credit among many accustomed elsewhere to laugh at such
fictions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For, after about three hours of night travelling, or
rather wading, among the sand-waves, till men and beasts alike
were ready to sink for weariness, a sharp altercation arose
between Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa and El-Ghannam, each proposing a
different direction of march.&nbsp; We all halted a moment, and
raised our eyes, heavy with drowsiness and fatigue, as if to see
which of the contending parties was in the right.&nbsp; It will
be long before I forget the impression of that moment.&nbsp;
Above us was the deep black sky, spangled with huge stars of a
brilliancy denied to all but an Arab gaze, while what is
elsewhere a ray of the third magnitude becomes here of the first
amid the pure vacuum of a mistless, vaporless air; around us
loomed high ridges, shutting us in before and behind with their
white, ghost-like outlines; below our feet the lifeless sand, and
everywhere a silence that seemed to belong to some strange and
dreamy world where man might not venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When not far from the midmost of the Dahna, we fell in
with a few Bedouins, belonging to the Aal-Morrah clan, sole
tenants of this desert.&nbsp; They were leading their goats to
little spots of scattered herbage and shrubs which here and there
fix a precarious existence in the hollows of the sands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theirs is the great desert from Nedjed to
Hadramaut.&nbsp; Not that they actually cover this immense space,
a good fourth of the peninsula, but that they <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>have the
free and undisputed range of the oases which it occasionally
offers, where herbs, shrubs, and dwarf-palms cluster round some
well of scant and briny water.&nbsp; These oases are sufficiently
numerous to preserve a stray Bedouin or two from perishing,
though not enough so to become landmarks for any regular route
across the central Dahna, from the main body of which runs out
the long and broad arm which we were now traversing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another night&rsquo;s bivouac, and then again over the
white down-sloping plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was now three days and a half since our last supply
of water, and Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa was anxious to reach the
journey&rsquo;s end without delay.&nbsp; As darkness closed
around we reached the farthermost heights of the coast-range of
Hasa.&nbsp; Hence we overlooked the plains of Hasa, but could
distinguish nothing through the deceptive rays of the rising
moon; we seemed to gaze into a vast milky ocean.&nbsp; After an
hour&rsquo;s halt for supper we wandered on, now up, now down,
over pass and crag, till a long, corkscrew descent down the
precipitous sea-side of the mountain, for a thousand feet or near
it, placed us fairly upon the low level of Hasa, and within the
warm, damp air of the sea-coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ground glimmered white to the moon, and gave a firm
footing to our dromedaries, who, by their renewed agility, seemed
to partake in the joy of their riders, and to understand that
rest was near.&nbsp; We were, in fact, all so eager to find
ourselves at home and homestead, that although the town of
Hofhoof, our destined goal, was yet full fifteen miles <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>to the
northeast, we pressed on for the capital.&nbsp; And there, in
fact, we should have all arrived in a body before day-dawn, had
not a singular occurrence retarded by far the greater number of
our companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soon after, the crags in our rear had shut out, perhaps
for years, perhaps forever, the desert and Central Arabia from
our view, while before and around us lay the indistinct
undulations and uncertain breaks of the great Hasa plain, when on
a sloping bank at a short distance in front we discerned certain
large black patches, in strong contrast with the white glister of
the soil around, and at the same time our attention was attracted
by a strange whizzing like that of a flight of hornets, close
along the ground, while our dromedaries capered and started as
though struck with sudden insanity.&nbsp; The cause of all this
was a vast swarm of locusts, here alighted in their northerly
wanderings from their birthplace in the Dahna; their camp
extended far and wide, and we had already disturbed their
outposts.&nbsp; These insects are wont to settle on the ground
after sunset, and there, half stupefied by the night chill, to
await the morning rays, which warm them once more into life and
movement.&nbsp; This time our dromedaries did the work of the
sun, and it would be hard to say which of the two were the most
frightened, they or the locusts.&nbsp; It was truly laughable to
see so huge a beast lose his wits for fear at the flight of a
harmless, stingless insect; of all timid creatures none equals
the &lsquo;ship of the desert&rsquo; for cowardice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The swarm now before us was a thorough godsend for our
Arabs, on no account to be neglected.&nbsp; <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>Thirst,
weariness, all was forgotten, and down the riders leapt from
their starting camels; this one spread out a cloak, that one a
saddle-bag, a third his shirt, over the unlucky creatures
destined for the morrow&rsquo;s meal.&nbsp; Some flew away
whirring across our feet, others were caught and tied up in
cloths and sacks.&nbsp; Cornish wreckers at work about a
shattered East Indiaman would be beaten by Ghannam and his
companions with the locusts.&nbsp; However, Barakat and myself
felt no special interest in the chase, nor had we much desire to
turn our dress and accoutrements into receptacles for living
game.&nbsp; Luckily Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa still retained enough of his
North Syrian education to be of our mind also.&nbsp; Accordingly
we left our associates hard at work, turned our startled and
still unruly dromedaries in the direction of Hofhoof, and set off
full speed over the plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not till near morning that we saw before us in
indistinct row the long black lines of the immense date-groves
that surround Hofhoof.&nbsp; Then, winding on amid rice-grounds
and cornfields, we left on our right an isolated fort (to be
described by daylight), passed some scattered villas, with their
gardens, approached the ruined town walls, and entered the
southern gate, now open and unguarded.&nbsp; Farther on a few
streets brought us before the door of Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa&rsquo;s
house, our desired resting-place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was still night.&nbsp; All was silent in the street
and house, at the entrance of which we now stood; indeed, none
but the master of a domicile could think of knocking at such an
hour, nor was <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa expected at that precise moment.&nbsp;
With much difficulty he contrived to awake the tenants; next the
shrill voice of the lady was heard within in accents of joy and
welcome; the door at last opened, and Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa invited us
into a dark passage, where a gas-light would have been a
remarkable improvement, and by this ushered us into the
k&rsquo;hawah.&nbsp; Here we lighted a fire, and after a hasty
refreshment all lay down to sleep, nor awoke till the following
forenoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Palgrave&rsquo;s
Travels&mdash;Eastern Arabia</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Our</span> stay at Hofhoof was very
pleasant and interesting, not indeed through personal incidents
and hair-breadth escapes&mdash;of which we had our fair portion
at Ri&rsquo;ad and elsewhere&mdash;but in the information here
acquired, and in the novel character of everything around us,
whether nature, art, or man.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa was very
anxious that we should see as much as possible of the country,
and procured us all means requisite for so doing, while the
shelter of his roof, and the precautions which he adopted or
suggested, obviated whatever dangers and inconveniences we had
experienced in former stages of the journey. Besides, the general
disposition of the inhabitants of Hasa is very different from
that met with in Nedjed, and even in Shomer or Djowf, and much
better adapted to make a stranger feel himself at home.&nbsp; A
sea-coast people, looking mainly to foreign lands and the ocean
for livelihood and commerce, accustomed to see among them not
unfrequently men of dress, manners, and religion different from
their own, many of them themselves travellers or voyagers to
Basrah, Bagdad, Bahreyn, Oman, and some even farther, they are
commonly free from that half-wondering, <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>half-suspicious feeling which the sight of a stranger
occasions in the isolated, desert-girded centre.&nbsp; In short,
experience, that best of masters, has gone far to unteach the
lessons of ignorance, intolerance, and national aversion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hofhoof, whose ample circuit contained during the last
generation about thirty thousand inhabitants, now dwindled to
twenty-three or twenty-four thousand, is divided into three
quarters or districts.&nbsp; The general form of the town is that
of a large oval.&nbsp; The public square, an oblong space of
about three hundred yards in length by a fourth of the same in
width, occupies the meeting point of these quarters; the
K&ocirc;t lies on its northeast, the Rifey&rsquo;eeyah on the
northwest and west, and the Na&rsquo;athar on the east and
south.&nbsp; In this last quarter was our present home; moreover,
it stood in the part farthest removed from the K&ocirc;t and its
sinister influences, while it was also sufficiently distant from
the overturbulent neighborhood of the Rifey&rsquo;eeyah, the
centre of anti-Wahabee movements, and the name of which alone
excited distrust and uneasiness in Nedjean minds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The K&ocirc;t itself is a vast citadel, surrounded by a
deep trench, with walls and towers of unusual height and
thickness, earth-built, with an occasional intermixture of stone,
the work of the old Carmathian rulers; it is nearly square, being
about one-third of a mile in length by one-quarter in
breadth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the opposite side of the square, and consequently
belonging to the Rifey&rsquo;eeyah, is the vaulted market-place,
or &lsquo;Keysareeyah,&rsquo; a name by which constructions of
this nature must henceforth be called up <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to Mascat
itself, though how this Latinism found its way across the
peninsula to lands which seem to have had so little commerce with
the Roman or Byzantine empires, I cannot readily
conjecture.&nbsp; This Keysareeyah is in form a long
barrel-vaulted arcade, with a portal at either end; the folding
doors that should protect the entrances have here in Hofhoof been
taken away, elsewhere they are always to be found.&nbsp; The
sides are composed of shops, set apart in general for wares of
cost, or at least what is here esteemed costly; thus, weapons,
cloth embroidery, gold and silver ornament, and analogous
articles, are the ordinary stock-in-hand in the
Keysareeyah.&nbsp; Around it cluster several alleys, roofed with
palm-leaves against the heat, and tolerably symmetrical; in the
shops we may see the merchandise of Bahreyn, Oman, Persia, and
India exposed for sale, mixed with the manufactured produce of
the country; workshops, smithies, carpenters&rsquo; and
shoemakers&rsquo; stalls, and the like, are here also.&nbsp; In
the open square itself stand countless booths for the sale of
dates, vegetables, wood, salted locusts, and small ware of many
kinds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rifey&rsquo;eeyah, or noble quarter, covers a
considerable extent, and is chiefly composed of tolerable, in
some places of even handsome, dwellings.&nbsp; The comparative
elegance of domestic architecture in Hofhoof is due to the use of
the arch, which, after the long interval from Ma&rsquo;an to
Hasa, now at last reappears, and gives to the constructions of
this province a lightness and a variety unknown in the monotonous
and heavy piles of Nedjed and Shomer.&nbsp; Another improvement
is that the walls, whether of earth or <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>stone, or
of both mixed, as is often the case, are here very generally
coated with fine white plaster, much resembling the
&lsquo;chunam&rsquo; of Southern India; ornament, too, is aimed
at about the doorways and the ogee-headed windows, and is
sometimes attained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Na&rsquo;athar is the largest quarter; it forms,
indeed, a good half of the town, and completes its oval.&nbsp; In
it every description of dwelling is to be seen&mdash;for rich and
poor, for high and low, palace or hovel.&nbsp; Here, too, but
near the K&ocirc;t, has the pious policy of Feysul constructed
the great mosque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps my reader, after accompanying me thus far,
may feel thirsty, for the heat, even in December, is almost
oppressive, and the sky cloudless as though it were June or
July.&nbsp; So let us turn aside into that grassy plantation,
where half a dozen buffaloes are cooling their ugly hides in a
pool, and drink a little from the source that supplies it.&nbsp;
When behold! the water is warm, almost hot.&nbsp; Do not be
surprised; all the fountain sources and wells of Hasa are so,
more or less; in some one can hardly bear to plunge one&rsquo;s
hand; others are less above the average temperature, while a
decidedly sulphurous taste is now and then perceptible.&nbsp; In
fact, from the extreme north of this province down to its
southern-most frontier, this same sign of subterranean fire is
everywhere to be found.&nbsp; The rocks, too, are here very
frequently of tufa and basalt, another mark of igneous
agency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The products of Hasa are many and various; the monotony
of Arab vegetation, its eternal palm and ithel, ithel and palm,
are here varied by new foliage, <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>and growths unknown to Nedjed and
Shomer.&nbsp; True, the date-palm still predominates, nay, here
attains its greatest perfection.&nbsp; But the nabak, with its
rounded leaves and little crab-apple fruit, a mere bush in
Central Arabia, becomes in Hasa a stately tree; the papay, too,
so well known in the more easterly peninsula, appears, though
seldom, and stunted in growth, along with some other trees,
common on the coast from Cutch to Bombay.&nbsp; Indigo is here
cultivated, though not sufficiently for the demands of commerce;
cotton is much more widely grown than in Yemamah; rice fields
abound, and the sugar-cane is often planted, though not, I
believe, for the extraction of the sugar.&nbsp; The peasants of
Hasa sell the reed by retail bundles in the market-place, and the
purchasers take it home to gnaw at leisure in their houses.&nbsp;
Corn, maize, millet, vetches of every kind, radishes, onions,
garlic, beans, in short, almost all legumina and cerealia, barley
excepted (at least I neither saw nor heard of any), cover the
plain, and under a better administration might be multiplied
tenfold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The climate of Hasa, as I have already implied, is very
different from that of the uplands, and not equally favorable to
health and physical activity.&nbsp; Hence, a doctor, like myself,
if my readers will allow me the title, has here more work and
better fees; this latter circumstance is also owing to the
greater amount of ready money in circulation, and the higher
value set on medical science by men whose intellects are much
more cultivated than those of their Nedjean neighbors.&nbsp; In
appearance, the inhabitants of Hasa are generally good-sized and
<a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>well-proportioned, but somewhat sallow in the face, and
of a less muscular development than is usual inland; their
features, though regular, are less marked than those of the
Nedjeans, and do not exhibit the same half-Jewish type.&nbsp; On
the contrary, there is something in them that reminds a beholder
of the Rajpoot or the Guzeratee.&nbsp; They are passionately fond
of literature and poetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already said that our great endeavor in Hasa was
to observe unobserved, and thus to render our time as barren as
might be in incidents and catastrophes.&nbsp; Not that we went
into the opposite extreme of leading an absolutely retired and
therefore uneventful life.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa took care from
the first to bring us into contact with the best and the most
cultivated families of the town, nor had my medical profession
anywhere a wider range for its exercise, or better success than
in Hofhoof.&nbsp; Friendly invitations, now to dinner, now to
supper, were of daily occurrence; and we sat at tables where
fish, no longer mere salted shrimps, announced our vicinity to
the coast; vermicelli, too, and other kinds of pastry, denoted
the influence of Persian art on the kitchen.&nbsp; Smoking within
doors was general; but the nargheelah often replaced, and that
advantageously, the short Arab pipe; perfumes are no less here in
use than in Nedjed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had passed about a week in the town when
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa entered the side room where Barakat and I were
enjoying a moment of quiet, and copying out &lsquo;Nabtee&rsquo;
poetry, and shut the door behind him.&nbsp; He then announced to
us, with a face and tone of <a name="page265"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 265</span>serious anxiety, that two of the
principal Nedjean agents belonging to the K&ocirc;t had just come
into the k&rsquo;hawah, under pretext of medical consultation,
but in reality, said he, to identify the strangers.&nbsp; We put
on our cloaks&mdash;a preliminary measure of decorum equivalent
to face- and hand-washing in Europe&mdash;and presented ourselves
before our inquisitors with an air of conscious innocence and
scientific solemnity.&nbsp; Conversation ensued, and we talked so
learnedly about bilious and sanguine complexions, cephalic veins,
and Indian drugs, with such apposite citations from the Koran,
and such loyal phrases for Feysul, that Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa was
beside himself for joy; and the spies, after receiving some
prescriptions of the bread-pill and aromatic-water formula, left
the house no wiser than before.&nbsp; Our friends, too, and they
were now many, well guessing what we might really be, partly from
our own appearance and partly from the known character of our
host (according to old Homer&rsquo;s true saying, <i>Heaven
always leads like to like</i>), did each and all their best to
throw sand into Wahabee eyes, and everything went on sociably and
smoothly.&nbsp; A blessing on the medical profession!&nbsp; None
other gives such excellent opportunities for securing everywhere
confidence and friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we leave Hasa I must add a few remarks to
complete the sketch given of the province and of its
inhabitants.&nbsp; Want of a suitable opportunity for inserting
them before has thrown them together at this point of my
narrative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fair readers will be pleased to learn that the veil
and other restraints inflicted on the gentle sex <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>by
Islamitic rigorism, not to say worse, are much less universal,
and more easily dispensed with in Hasa; while in addition, the
ladies of the land enjoy a remarkable share of those natural
gifts which no institutions, and even no cosmetics, can confer;
namely, beauty of face and elegance of form.&nbsp; Might I
venture on the delicate and somewhat invidious task of
constructing a &lsquo;beauty-scale&rsquo; for Arabia, and for
Arabia alone, the Bedouin women would, on this kalometer, be
represented by zero, or at most 1&deg;; a degree higher would
represent the female sex of Nedjed; above them rank the women of
Shomer, who are in their turn surmounted by those of Djowf.&nbsp;
The fifth or sixth degree symbolizes the fair ones of Hasa; the
seventh those of Katar; and lastly, by a sudden rise of ten
degrees at least, the seventeenth or eighteenth would denote the
pre-eminent beauties of Oman.&nbsp; Arab poets occasionally
languish after the charmers of Hedjaz; I never saw anyone to
charm me, but then I only skirted the province.&nbsp; All bear
witness to the absence of female loveliness in Yemen; and I
should much doubt whether the mulatto races and dusky complexions
of Hadramaut have much to vaunt of.&nbsp; But in Hasa a decided
improvement on this important point is agreeably evident to the
traveller arriving from Nedjed, and he will be yet further
delighted on finding his Calypsos much more conversible, and
having much more, too, in their conversation than those he left
behind him in Sedeyr and &rsquo;Aared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During our stay at Hofhoof, Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa left
untried no arts of Arab rhetoric and persuasion to <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>determine
me to visit Oman, assuring me again and again that whatever we
had yet seen, even in his favorite Hasa, was nothing compared to
what remained to see in that more remote country.&nbsp; My
companion, tired of our long journey, and thinking the long
distance already laid between him and his Syrian home quite
sufficient in itself without further leagues tacked on to it, was
very little disposed for a supplementary expedition.&nbsp;
Englishmen, on the contrary, are rovers by descent and habit; my
own mind was now fully made up to visit Oman at all risks,
whether Barakat came with me or not.&nbsp; Meanwhile, we formed
our plan for the next immediate stage of our route.&nbsp; My
companion and I were to quit Hofhoof together, leaving
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa behind us for a week or two at Hasa, while we
journeyed northward to Kateef, and thence took ship for the town
of Menamah in Bahreyn.&nbsp; In this latter place
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa was to rejoin us.&nbsp; Our main reason for thus
separating our movements in time and in direction, was to avoid
the too glaring appearance of acting in concert while yet in a
land under Wahabee government and full of Wahabee spies and
reporters, especially after the suspicions thrown on us at
Ri&rsquo;ad.&nbsp; The Oman arrangements were to be deferred till
we should all meet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barakat and myself prepared for our departure; we
purchased a few objects of local curiosity, got in our dues of
medical attendance, paid and received the customary P. P. C.
visits, and even tendered our respects to the negro governor
Belal, where he sat at his palace door in the K&ocirc;t, holding
a public <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>audience, and looking much like any other well-dressed
black.&nbsp; No passport was required for setting out on the road
to Kateef, which in the eyes of government forms only one and the
same province with Hasa, though in many respects very different
from it.&nbsp; The road is perfectly secure; plundering Bedouins
or highway robbers are here out of the question.&nbsp; However,
we stood in need of companions, not for escort, but as
guides.&nbsp; Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa made inquiries in the town, and
found three men who chanced to be just then setting out on their
way for Kateef, who readily consented to join band with us for
the road.&nbsp; Our Abyssinian hostess supplied us with a whole
sack of provisions, and our Hofhoof associates found us in
camels.&nbsp; Thus equipped and mounted, we took an almost
touching leave of Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa&rsquo;s good-natured wife,
kissed the baby, exchanged an <i>au revoir</i> with its father,
and set out on the afternoon of December 19th, leaving behind us
many pleasant acquaintances, from some of whom I received
messages and letters while at Bahreyn.&nbsp; So far as
inhabitants are concerned, to no town in Arabia should I return
with equal confidence of finding a hearty greeting and a welcome
reception, than to Hofhoof and its amiable and intelligent
merchants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We quitted the town by the northeastern gate of the
Rifey-&rsquo;eeyah, where the friends, who, according to Arab
custom, had accompanied us thus far in a sort of procession,
wished us a prosperous journey, took a last adieu, and returned
home.&nbsp; After some hours we bivouacked on a little hillock of
clean sand, with the dark line of the Hofhoof woods on our <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>left, while
at some distance in front a copious fountain poured out its
rushing waters with a noise distinctly audible in the stillness
of the night, and irrigated a garden worthy of Damascus or
Antioch.&nbsp; The night air was temperate, neither cold like
that of Nedjed, nor stifling like that of Southern India; the sky
clear and starry.&nbsp; From our commanding position on the hill
I could distinguish Soheyl or Canopus, now setting; and following
him, not far above the horizon, the three upper stars of the
Southern Cross, an old Indian acquaintance; two months later in
Oman I had the view of the entire constellation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning we traversed a large plain of light and
sandy soil, intersected by occasional ridges of basalt and
sandstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We journeyed on all day, meeting no Bedouins and few
travellers.&nbsp; At evening we encamped in a shallow valley,
near a cluster of brimming wells, some sweet, some brackish,
where the traces of half-obliterated watercourses and the
vestiges of crumbling house-walls indicated the former existence
of a village, now also deserted.&nbsp; We passed a comfortable
night under the shelter of palms and high brushwood, mixed with
gigantic aloes and yuccas, and rose next morning early to our
way.&nbsp; Our direction lay northeast.&nbsp; In the afternoon we
caught our first glimpse of Djebel Mushahhar, a pyramidical peak
some seven hundred feet high and about ten miles south of
Kateef.&nbsp; But the sea, though I looked toward it and for it
with an eagerness somewhat resembling that of the Ten Thousand on
their approach to the <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>Euxine, remained shut out from view
by a further continuation of the heights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day we rose at dawn, and crossed the hills of
Kateef by a long winding path, till after some hours of
labyrinthine track we came in sight of the dark plantation-line
that girdles Kateef itself landward.&nbsp; The sea lies
immediately beyond; this we knew, but we could not obtain a
glimpse of its waters through the verdant curtain stretched
between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About midday we descended the last slope, a steep
sandstone cliff, which looks as though it had been the sea-limit
of a former period.&nbsp; We now stood on the coast itself.&nbsp;
Its level is as nearly as possible that of the Gulf beyond; a few
feet of a higher tide than usual would cover it up to the
cliffs.&nbsp; Hence it is a decidedly unhealthy land, though
fertile and even populous; but the inhabitants are mostly weak in
frame and sallow in complexion.&nbsp; The atmosphere was thick
and oppressive, the heat intense, and the vegetation hung rich
and heavy around; my companions talked about suffocation, and I
remembered once more the Indian coast.&nbsp; Another hour of
afternoon march brought us to Kateef itself, at its western
portal; a high stone arch of elegant form, and flanked by walls
and towers, but all dismantled and ruinous.&nbsp; Close by the
two burial-grounds, one for the people of the land, the other for
the Nedjean rulers and colony&mdash;divided even after death by
mutual hatred and anathema.&nbsp; Folly, if you will, but folly
not peculiar to the East.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The town itself is crowded, damp, and dirty, and has
altogether a gloomy, what for want of a better <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>epithet I
would call a <i>mouldy</i>, look; much business was going on in
the market and streets, but the ill-favored and very un-Arab look
of the shopkeepers and workmen confirms what history tells of the
Persian colonization of this city.&nbsp; Indeed, the inhabitants
of the entire district, but more especially of the capital, are a
mongrel race, in which Persian blood predominates, mixed with
that of Bassora, Bagdad, and the &rsquo;Irak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We urged our starting dromedaries across the open
square in front of the market-place, traversed the town in its
width, which is scarce a quarter of its length (like other coast
towns), till we emerged from the opposite gate, and then looked
out with greedy eyes for the sea, now scarce ten minutes
distant.&nbsp; In vain as yet, so low lies the land, and so thick
cluster the trees.&nbsp; But after a turn or two we came
alongside of the outer walls, belonging to the huge fortress of
Karmoot, and immediately afterward the valley opening out showed
us almost at our feet the dead shallow flats of the bay.&nbsp;
How different from the bright waters of the Mediterranean, all
glitter and life, where we had bidden them farewell eight months
before at Gaza!&nbsp; Like a leaden sheet, half ooze, half sedge,
the muddy sea lay in view, waveless, motionless; to our left the
massive walls of the castle went down almost to the water&rsquo;s
edge, and then turned to leave a narrow esplanade between its
circuit and the Gulf.&nbsp; On this ledge were ranged a few rusty
guns of large calibre, to show how the place was once guarded;
and just in front of the main gate a crumbling outwork, which a
single cannon-shot <a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>would level with the ground, displayed six pieces of
honey-combed artillery, their mouths pointing seaward.&nbsp; Long
stone benches without invited us to leave our camels crouching on
the esplanade, while we seated ourselves and rested a little
before requesting the governor to grant us a day&rsquo;s
hospitality, and permission to embark for Bahreyn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barakat and I sat still to gaze, speculating on the
difference between the two sides of Arabia.&nbsp; But our
companions, like true Arabs, thought it high time for
&lsquo;refreshment,&rsquo; and accordingly began their inquiries
at the castle-gate where the governor might be, and whether he
was to be spoken to.&nbsp; When, behold! the majesty of
Feysul&rsquo;s vicegerent issuing in person from his palace to
visit the new man-of-war.&nbsp; My abolitionist friends will be
gratified to learn that this exalted dignitary is, no less than
he of Hofhoof, a negro, brought up from a curly-headed imp to a
woolly-headed black in Feysul&rsquo;s own palace, and now
governor of the most important harbor owned by Nedjed on the
Persian Gulf, and of the town once capital of that fierce dynasty
which levelled the Kaabah with the dust, and filled Kateef with
the plunder of Yemen and Syria.&nbsp; Farhat, to give him his
proper name, common among those of his complexion, was a fine
tall negro of about fifty years old, good-natured, chatty,
hospitable, and furnished with perhaps a trifle more than the
average amount of negro intellect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa, who had friends and acquaintances
everywhere, and whose kindly manner made him always a special
favorite with negroes high or low, had furnished us with an
introductory letter to <a name="page273"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 273</span>Farhat, intended to make matters
smooth for our future route.&nbsp; But as matters went there was
little need of caution.&nbsp; The fortunate coincidence of a
strong north wind, just then blowing down the Gulf, gave a
satisfactory reason for not embarking on board of a Bassora
cruiser, while it rendered a voyage to Bahreyn, our real object,
equally specious and easy.&nbsp; Besides, Farhat himself, who was
a good, easy-going sort of man, had hardly opened
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa&rsquo;s note, than without more ado he bade us a
hearty welcome, ordered our luggage to be brought within the
castle precincts, and requested us to step in ourselves and take
a cup of coffee, awaiting his return for further conversation
after his daily visit of inspection to Feysul&rsquo;s abridged
fleet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next day passed, partly in Farhat&rsquo;s
k&rsquo;hawah, partly in strolling about the castle, town,
gardens, and beach, making, meanwhile, random inquiries after
boats and boatmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was noon when we fell in with a ship captain, ready
to sail that very night, wind and tide permitting.&nbsp;
Farhat&rsquo;s men had spoken with him, and he readily offered to
take us on board.&nbsp; We then paid a visit to the custom-house
officer to settle the embarkation dues for men and goods.&nbsp;
This foreman of the Ma&rsquo;asher, whether in accordance with
orders from Farhat, or of his own free will and inclination, I
know not, proved wonderfully gracious, and declared that to take
a farthing of duty from such useful servants of the public as
doctors, would be &lsquo;sheyn w&rsquo;khata&rsquo;, &lsquo;shame
and sin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Alas, that European custom house officials
should be far removed from <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>such generous and patriotic
sentiments!&nbsp; Lastly, of his own accord he furnished us with
men to carry our baggage through knee-deep water and thigh-deep
mud to the little cutter, where she lay some fifty yards from
shore.&nbsp; Evening now came on, and Farhat sent for us to
congratulate us, but with a polite regret on having found so
speedy conveyance for our voyage.&nbsp; Meanwhile he let us
understand how he was himself invited for the evening to supper
with a rich merchant of the town, and that we were expected to
join the party; nor need that make us anxious about our passage,
since our ship captain was also invited, nor could the vessel
possibly sail before the full tide at midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From our town supper we returned by torchlight to the
castle; our baggage, no great burden, had been already taken down
to the sea gate, where stood two of the captain&rsquo;s men
waiting for us.&nbsp; In their company we descended to the beach,
and then with garments tucked up to the waist waded to the
vessel, not without difficulty, for the tide was rapidly coming
in, and we had almost to swim for it.&nbsp; At last we reached
the ship and scrambled up her side; most heartily glad was I to
find myself at sea once more on the other side of
Arabia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a slow voyage of three days Palgrave reached Bahreyn,
the headquarters of the pearl fisheries, and established himself
in the little town of Moharrek, to wait for the arrival of
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa before undertaking his projected exploration of
Oman.&nbsp; He and his companion enjoyed a grateful feeling of
rest and security in this seaport among the sailors, to <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>whom all
varieties of foreigners were well known, and who, having no
prejudices, felt no suspicion.</p>
<p>On January 9, 1863, Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa arrived, and after much
earnest consultation the following plan was adopted:
Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa was to send twenty loads of the best Hasa dates,
and a handsome mantle, as presents to the Sultan of Oman, with
three additional mantles for the three chiefs whose territories
intervened between Bahreyn and Muscat.&nbsp; Palgrave was to
accompany these gifts, under his character of a skilled physician
in quest of certain rare and mysterious herbs of Oman.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa and Barakat would take passage for
Aboo-Shahr (Busheer), in Persia, where the former would be
employed for three months in making up his next caravan of Mecca
pilgrims.&nbsp; Here Palgrave was to rejoin them after his
journey.</p>
<p>In place of Barakat his companion was a curious individual
named Yoosef, whom Aboo-&rsquo;Eysa had rescued from misery and
maintained in a decent condition.&nbsp; He was a native of Hasa,
half a jester and half a knave; witty, reckless, hare brained to
the last degree, full of jocose or pathetic stories, of poetry,
traditions, and fun of every description.&nbsp; When everything
had been arranged the four parted company, Palgrave and his new
companion sailing for the port of Bedaa&rsquo;, on the Arabian
coast, where resided the first of the three chiefs whose
protection it was necessary to secure.&nbsp; They reached there
after a cruise of five or six days, finding the place very barren
and desolate, with scarcely a tree or a garden; but, as the chief
said to Palgrave, &ldquo;We are all, from <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>the highest
to the lowest, the slaves of one master&mdash;Pearl.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The bay contains the best pearl-fishery on the coast, and the
town depends for its existence on the trade in these gems.</p>
<p>The chief was intelligent and friendly, and appears to have
interposed no obstacle to the proposed journey into the interior,
but Palgrave decided to go on by sea to the town of Sharjah, on
the northern side of the peninsula of Oman.&nbsp; Embarking again
on February 6th, the vessel was driven by violent winds across to
the Persian shore, and ten days elapsed before it was possible to
reach Sharjah.&nbsp; Here, again, although their reception was
hospitable, the travellers gave up their land journey and
re-embarked in another vessel to pass around the peninsula,
through the Straits of Ormuz, and land on the southern shore, in
the territory of Muscat.</p>
<p>In three days they reached the island of Ormuz, of which
Palgrave says: &ldquo;I was not at all sorry to have an
opportunity of visiting an island once so renowned for its
commerce, and of which its Portuguese occupants used to say,
&lsquo;that, were the world a golden ring Ormuz would be the
diamond signet.&rsquo;&nbsp; The general appearance of Ormuz
indicates an extinguished volcano, and such I believe it really
is; the circumference consists of a wide oval wall, formed by
steep crags, fire-worn and ragged; these enclose a central basin,
where grow shrubs and grass; the basaltic slopes of the outer
barrier run in many places clean down into the sea, amid
splinter-like pinnacles and fantastic crags of many colors, like
those which lava often assumes on cooling.&nbsp; Between <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>the west
and north a long triangular promontory, low and level, advances
to a considerable distance, and narrows into a neck of land,
which is terminated by a few rocks and a strong fortress, the
work of Portuguese builders, but worthy of taking rank among
Roman ruins&mdash;so solid are the walls, so compact the masonry
and well-selected brickwork, against which three long centuries
of sea-storm have broken themselves in vain.&nbsp; The greater
part of the promontory itself is covered with ruins.&nbsp; Here
stood the once thriving town, now a confused extent of desolate
heaps, amid which the vestiges of several fine dwellings, of
baths, and of a large church may yet be clearly made out.&nbsp;
Close by the fort cluster a hundred or more wretched
earth-hovels, the abode of fishermen or shepherds, whose flocks
pasture within the crater; one single shed, where dried dates,
raisins, and tobacco are exposed for sale, is all that now
remains of the trade of Ormuz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After being detained three days at Ormuz by a storm, the
vessel passed through the Strait, skirted the southern coast of
the peninsula, and reached the harbor of Sohar on March 3d.&nbsp;
Palgrave determined to set off with Yoosef the same evening on
the land-journey of eight or nine days to Muscat; but he had
already lost so much time by delays since leaving Bahreyn that he
yielded to the persuasions of the captain of another vessel, who
promised to take him to Muscat by sea in two days.&nbsp; He
sailed on the 6th, weighed down with a vague presentiment of
coming evil, which was soon to be justified.&nbsp; His wanderings
in Arabia, and also in this world, very <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>nearly came
to an end.&nbsp; The vessel slowly glided on for two days, and
Muscat was almost in sight when a dead, ominous calm befell them
near the Sowadah Islands&mdash;some low reefs of barren rocks,
about three leagues from shore.&nbsp; It proved to be a calm,
ominous indeed for Palgrave, as well as for the captain of the
vessel and all on board.&nbsp; It was followed by a furious storm
that ended in the wreck of the dhow, and the loss of several
lives, together with the entire outfit of the expedition.&nbsp;
Palgrave and the survivors of the crew and passengers, nine in
number, barely escaped with their lives, and reached the shore
utterly exhausted, with nothing but the shirts they wore.</p>
<p>In sorry plight the traveller made his way along the coast to
Muscat.&nbsp; He was obliged to give up the idea of exploring the
interior of Oman, partly on account of the loss of the stores but
chiefly because his identity as a European had been disclosed;
and so in this disastrous manner ended the most important and
interesting journey that had yet been made by any traveller in
Arabia.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><span class="smcap">Lady Blunt&rsquo;s
Pilgrimage to Nejd</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> 1878&ndash;79, sixteen years
after Palgrave&rsquo;s journey, Lady Anne Blunt, with her husband
and several native servants, accomplished a journey, which, in
many respects was more remarkable than the exploits of any of
their predecessors.&nbsp; Whereas Palgrave and others had
travelled in disguise, believing it impossible to penetrate into
the interior otherwise than as mussulmans, the Blunts made no
pretences of the kind, but went as European travellers, desirous
of seeing the country, and visiting its rulers.&nbsp; They
traversed the whole breadth of the peninsula, from Beyrout on the
Mediterranean coast, to Bagdad on the Tigris, crossing the Great
Nefood, or central desert, and visiting Hail, Jebel Shammer, and
other places in Nejd. <a name="citation279"></a><a
href="#footnote279" class="citation">[279]</a></p>
<p>On their return Lady Blunt published the remarkably
interesting story of their adventures, under the title of
&ldquo;A Pilgrimage to Nejd,&rdquo; a book which added greatly to
our knowledge of the Arabian <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>interior, and to which the compiler
of this chapter is largely indebted.</p>
<p>The travellers entered upon their adventurous undertaking with
the advantage of experiences gained on a previous journey among
the Arab tribes of the Euphrates Valley, and a knowledge of the
Arab tongue.&nbsp; Their native servants, who had accompanied
them on their previous expedition, eagerly joined their service
for the new venture; camels, horses, and all necessary supplies
for the journey were purchased at Damascus, and on December 12th,
1879, the start was made.</p>
<p>Though unwilling to travel under false colors as to race or
nationality, the English travellers found it convenient to adopt
the Bedouin costume for the desert journey, to avoid attracting
more notice than was necessary.&nbsp; Their first objective point
was J&ocirc;f, an important oasis in the desert, four hundred
miles away.&nbsp; Lady Blunt, describing the start from Damascus,
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first we skirted the city, passing the gate where
St. Paul is said to have entered, and the place where he got over
the wall, and then along the suburb of Ma&iuml;dan, which is the
quarter occupied by Bedouins when they come to town, and where we
had found the Tudmuri and our camels.&nbsp; Here we were to have
met the Jerdeh, and we waited some time outside the Baw&acirc;bat
Allah, or &lsquo;Gates of God,&rsquo; while Mohammed went in to
make inquiries and take leave of his Tudmuri friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in front of this gate that the pilgrims assemble
on the day of their start for Mecca, and from it <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>the Haj
road leads away in a nearly straight line southward.&nbsp; The
Haj road is to be our route as far as Mez&aacute;rib, and is a
broad, well-worn track, though of course not a road at all
according to English ideas.&nbsp; It has, nevertheless, a sort of
romantic interest, one cannot help feeling, going as it does so
far and through such desolate lands, a track so many thousand
travellers have followed never to return.&nbsp; I suppose in its
long history a grave may have been dug for every yard of its
course from Damascus to Medina, for, especially on the return
journey, there are constantly deaths among the pilgrims from
weariness and insufficient food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A leisurely journey of a week brought the party to Salkhad, a
Druse community at the edge of the desert, where Huseyn, the
Sheykh of the Druses provided them with guides to the K&acirc;f
oasis, a five days&rsquo; journey into the desert.&nbsp; On the
way to K&acirc;f they passed areas of sand, white as snow, and
encountered violent sand-storms, in one of which they lost a
camel who seized his opportunity to escape back to
Mez&aacute;rib.&nbsp; Beyond K&acirc;f they met with rather a
thrilling adventure, which is thus graphically described:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday, January 3d.&mdash;We have had an adventure at
last, and rather a disagreeable one; a severe lesson as to the
danger of encamping near wells.&nbsp; We started early, but were
delayed a whole hour at Jerawi taking water, and did not leave
the wells till nearly eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Then we turned
back nearly due east across the wady.&nbsp; The soil of pure
white sand was heavy going, and we went slowly, crossing low
undulations without other landmark than the <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>wells we
had left behind us.&nbsp; Here and there rose little mounds,
tufted with ghada.&nbsp; To one of these Wilfrid and I cantered
on, leaving the camels behind us, and dismounting, tied our mares
to the bushes, that we might enjoy a few minutes&rsquo; rest and
eat our midday mouthful; the greyhounds meanwhile played about
and chased each other in the sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had finished, and were talking of I know not what,
when the camels passed us.&nbsp; They were hardly a couple of
hundred yards in front, when suddenly we heard a thud, thud,
thud, on the sand, a sound of galloping.&nbsp; Wilfrid jumped to
his feet, looked round, and called out: &lsquo;Get on your
mare.&nbsp; This is a ghaz&uacute;!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I scrambled round the bush to my mare, I saw a troop
of horsemen charging down at full gallop with their lances, not
two hundred yards off.&nbsp; Wilfrid was up as he spoke, and so
should I have been but for my sprained knee and the deep sand,
both of which gave way as I was rising.&nbsp; I fell back.&nbsp;
There was no time to think, and I had hardly struggled to my feet
when the enemy was upon us, and I was knocked down by a
spear.&nbsp; Then they all turned on Wilfrid, who had waited for
me, some of them jumping down on foot to get hold of his
mare&rsquo;s halter.&nbsp; He had my gun with him, which I had
just before handed to him, but unloaded, his own gun and his
sword being on his del&uacute;l (riding camel).&nbsp; He
fortunately had on very thick clothes, two abbas one over the
other, and English clothes underneath, so the lances did him no
harm.&nbsp; At last his assailants managed to get his gun from
him and broke it over <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>his head, hitting him three times
and smashing the stock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resistance seemed to me useless, and I shouted to the
nearest horseman, &lsquo;<i>Ana dah&iacute;lak</i>&rsquo; (I am
under your protection), the usual form of surrender.&nbsp;
Wilfrid hearing this, and thinking he had had enough of this
unequal contest, one against twelve, threw himself off his
mare.&nbsp; The <i>Khayal</i> (horsemen) having seized both the
mares, paused, and as soon as they had gathered breath, began to
ask us who we were and where we came from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;English, and we have come from Damascus,&rsquo;
we replied, &lsquo;and our camels are close by.&nbsp; Come with
us and you shall hear about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our caravan, while all this had happened, and it only
lasted about five minutes, had formed itself into a square, and
the camels were kneeling down, as we could plainly see from where
we were.&nbsp; I hardly expected the horsemen to do as we asked,
but the man who seemed to be their leader at once let us walk on
(a process causing me acute pain), and followed with the others
to the caravan.&nbsp; We found Mohammed and the rest of our party
entrenched behind the camels with their guns pointed, and as we
approached, Mohammed stepped out and came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Min entum?&rsquo; (Who are you?) was the first
question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Roala min Ibn Debaa.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wallah?&rsquo; (Will you swear by God?)&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wallah!&rsquo; (We swear).</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Mohammed ibn
Ar&ucirc;k of Tudmur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wallah?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Wallah!&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;And these are Franjis <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>travelling with you?&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Wallah!&nbsp; Franjis, friends of Ibn Shaalan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all right; we had fallen into the hands of
friends.&nbsp; Ibn Shaalan, our host of last year, was bound to
protect us, even so far away in the desert, and none of his
people dared meddle with us, knowing this.&nbsp; Besides,
Mohammed was a Tudmuri, and as such could not be molested by
Roala, for Tudmur pays tribute to Ibn Shaalan, and the Tudmuris
have a right to his protection.&nbsp; So as soon as the
circumstances were made clear orders were given by the chief of
the party to his followers to bring back our mares, and the gun,
and everything which had been dropped in the scuffle.&nbsp; Even
to Wilfrid&rsquo;s tobacco-bag, all was restored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The robbers and the travellers fraternized after the affair
was over, and the former were very much ashamed of themselves for
having used their spears against a woman.&nbsp; Lady Blunt
apologizes for them, however, as the Bedouin dress she wore for
riding prevented them distinguishing her sex in the confusion of
the sudden attack.</p>
<p>Two days after the encounter in the desert the party arrived
at J&ocirc;f, where they spent three days, and found the people
very hospitable.&nbsp; Their chief servant and camel-driver,
Mohammed, was an Arab, who had distant connections in this part
of Arabia; and as tribal kinship, no matter how remote, is
regarded as a matter of great importance, this relationship was
of material aid in securing them the good-will of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; The Blunts were less favorably impressed with
J&ocirc;f than was Palgrave, <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>who, however, uses the term
&ldquo;Djowf&rdquo; in a broader sense, as including a number of
oases situated in &ldquo;a large oval depression of sixty or
seventy miles long by ten or twelve broad, lying between the
northern desert that separates it from Syria and the Euphrates,
and the southern Nefood, or sandy waste, and interposed between
it and the nearest mountains of the Central Arabian
plateau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Blunt writes of it: &ldquo;J&ocirc;f is not at all what
we expected.&nbsp; We thought we should find it a large
cultivated district, and it turns out to be merely a small
town.&nbsp; There is nothing at all outside the walls except a
few square patches, half an acre or so each, green with young
corn,&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>How true is it that no two travellers see things with the same
eyes.&nbsp; Doubtless both these distinguished travellers are
reasonably correct in their descriptions, but summed up their
impressions from opposite stand-points in a topographical sense;
a common enough mistake in Asia, where the name of a place often
indicates, equally accurately, a large scope of country and the
central spot in it.&nbsp; In Central Asia, for example, there is
Merv, which is the name of a city, and also of the large fertile
oasis in which it is situated; also Herat, meaning a broad area
of oases, with a population of probably half a million people, in
which the fortress-city Herat stands, no less than the city
itself.</p>
<p>Important political changes had taken place since
Palgrave&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; The rule of the Wahabees had been
overthrown in J&ocirc;f, and the only representatives of staple
authority found there were a Sheykh and <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>six
soldiers, who represented the authority of Mohammed ibn Rashid,
Emir of Jebel Shammar, with his seat of government at Hail.</p>
<p>From J&ocirc;f the travellers proceeded toward Hail, crossing
the dreaded Nefood, of which they give a very interesting, and
far less gloomy, account than did Palgrave.&nbsp; They, however,
crossed it in January, while Palgrave crossed it in midsummer; so
that, in the case of the Nefood, as with J&ocirc;f, the
apparently conflicting accounts are doubtless both fairly
accurate, the one describing the desert in winter, the other in
summer.&nbsp; On January 12th, the travellers found themselves on
the edge of the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At half-past three o&rsquo;clock we saw a red streak on
the horizon before us, which rose and gathered as we approached
it, stretching out east and west in an unbroken line.&nbsp; It
might at first have been taken for an effect of mirage, but on
coming nearer we found it broken into billows, and but for its
red color not unlike a stormy sea seen from the shore, for it
rose up, as the sea seems to rise, when the waves are high, above
the level of the land.&nbsp; Somebody called out
&lsquo;Nef&ucirc;d,&rsquo; and though for a while we were
incredulous, we were soon convinced.&nbsp; What surprised us was
its color, that of rhubarb and magnesia, nothing at all like what
we had expected.&nbsp; Yet the Nef&ucirc;d it was, the great red
desert of Central Arabia.&nbsp; In a few minutes we had cantered
up to it, and our mares were standing with their feet in its
first waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;January 13th.&mdash;We have been all day in the
Nef&ucirc;d, which is interesting beyond our hopes, and charming
into the bargain.&rdquo;&nbsp; After taking issue with <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>Mr.
Palgrave, who, Lady Blunt thinks, overlooked its brighter side,
the narrator continues her own observations thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing that strikes one first about the Nef&ucirc;d
is its color.&nbsp; It is not white like the sand dunes we passed
yesterday, nor yellow as the sand is in parts of the Egyptian
desert, but a really bright red, almost crimson in the morning,
when it is wet with dew.&nbsp; The sand is rather coarse, but
absolutely pure, without admixture of any foreign substance,
pebble, grit, or earth, and exactly the same in tint and texture
everywhere.&nbsp; It is, however, a great mistake to suppose it
barren.&nbsp; The Nef&ucirc;d, on the contrary, is better wooded
and richer in pasture than any part of the desert we have passed
since leaving Damascus.&nbsp; It is tufted all over with ghada
bushes, and bushes of another kind called <i>yerta</i>, which at
this time of the year, when there are no leaves, is exactly like
a thickly matted vine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, besides, several kinds of camel pasture,
especially one new to us, called <i>adr</i>, on which they say
sheep can feed for a month without wanting water, and more than
one kind of grass.&nbsp; Both camels and mares are therefore
pleased with the place, and we are delighted with the abundance
of firewood for our camps.&nbsp; Wilfrid says that the
Nef&ucirc;d has solved for him at last the mystery of
horse-breeding in Central Arabia.&nbsp; In the hard desert there
is nothing a horse can eat, but here there is plenty.&nbsp; The
Nef&ucirc;d accounts for everything.&nbsp; Instead of being the
terrible place it has been described by the few travellers who
have seen it, it is in reality the home of the <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>Bedouins
during a great part of the year.&nbsp; Its only want is water,
for it contains but few wells; all along the edge it is thickly
inhabited, and Radi tells us that in the spring, when the grass
is green after rain, the Bedouins care nothing for water, as
their camels are in milk, and they go for weeks without it,
wandering far into the interior of the sand desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the desert of sand the travellers found many curious
hollows, which the native guide called fulj.&nbsp; Some of these
holes were a quarter of a mile in diameter, and as much as 230
feet deep.&nbsp; They were chiefly of horse-hoof shape.&nbsp;
They took observations, and at one point on the desert found the
elevation to be 3,300 feet above sea-level.&nbsp; After seven
days in the Nef&ucirc;d, the last two of which tried the
endurance of men and beasts, the party reached the oasis of
Jobba, which is described as being one of the most curious, as
also most beautiful, places in the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Its name Jobba, meaning a well, explains its position,
for it lies in a hole or well in the Nef&ucirc;d; not indeed in a
fulj, for the basin of Jobba is quite on another scale, and has
nothing in common with the horse-hoof depressions I have hitherto
described.&nbsp; It is, all the same, extremely singular, and
quite as difficult to account for geologically as the
fuljes.&nbsp; It is a great bare space in the ocean of sand, from
four to five hundred feet below its average level, and about
three miles wide; a hollow, in fact, not unlike that of
J&ocirc;f, but with the Nef&ucirc;d round it instead of sandstone
cliffs.&nbsp; That it has once been a lake is pretty evident, for
there are distinct water marks on the rocks, which crop up out of
the bed just above the <a name="page289"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 289</span>town; and, strange to say, there is
a tradition still extant of there having been formerly water
there.&nbsp; The wonder is how this space is kept clear of
sand.&nbsp; What force is it that walls out the Nef&ucirc;d and
prevents encroachments?&nbsp; As you look across the subbkha, or
dry bed of the lake, the Nef&ucirc;d seems like a wall of water
which must overwhelm it; and yet no sand shifts down into the
hollow, and its limits are accurately maintained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length the Nef&ucirc;d was overcome and the travellers
approached Hail, not without apprehensions as to the reception
that might await them.&nbsp; Their guide from J&ocirc;f
enlightened them in regard to many changes that had occurred
since Palgrave&rsquo;s visit, changes that will be equally
interesting to readers who have followed Palgrave&rsquo;s
narrative in preceding chapters.</p>
<p>Telal, then despotic ruler at Hail (Ha&rsquo;yel), had gone
insane and committed suicide by stabbing himself with his own
dagger four years after Palgrave&rsquo;s visit.&nbsp; He was
succeeded by his brother Metaab, who, however, died suddenly
after reigning three years; when a dispute arose between his
brother Mohammed and Telal&rsquo;s oldest son, Bender, about the
succession.&nbsp; Mohammed being away at the time, Bender, a
youth of twenty, was proclaimed Emir.&nbsp; Mohammed returned,
and in a violent quarrel with his nephew drew his dagger and
stabbed him to death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Mohammed galloped back to the castle, and finding
Ham&ucirc;d (son of Obeyd, uncle of Telal) there, got his help
and took possession of the palace.&nbsp; He then seized the
younger sons of Tell&aacute;l (Palgrave&rsquo;s <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>Telal),
Bender&rsquo;s brothers, all but one child, Na&iuml;f, and Bedr,
who was away from Hail, and had their heads cut off by his slaves
in the court-yard of the castle.&nbsp; They say, however, that
Ham&uacute;d protested against this.&nbsp; But Mohammed was
reckless, or wished to strike terror, and not satisfied with what
he had already done, went on destroying his relations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had some cousins, sons of Jabar, a younger brother
of Abdallah and Obeyd; and these he sent for.&nbsp; They came in
some alarm to the castle, each with his slave.&nbsp; They were
all young men, beautiful to look at, and of the highest
distinction; and their slaves had been brought up with them, as
the custom is, more like brothers than servants.&nbsp; They were
shown into the kahwah of the castle, and received with great
formality, Mohammed&rsquo;s servants coming forward to invite
them in.&nbsp; It is the custom at Hail, whenever a person pays a
visit, that before sitting down he should hang up his sword on
one of the wooden pegs fixed into the wall, and this the sons of
Jabar did, and their slaves likewise.&nbsp; Then they sat down
and waited and waited, but still no coffee was served to
them.&nbsp; At last Mohammed appeared, surrounded by his guard,
but there was no &lsquo;salaam aleykum,&rsquo; and instantly he
gave orders that his cousins should be seized and bound.&nbsp;
They made a rush for their swords, but were intercepted by the
slaves of the castle and made prisoners.&nbsp; Mohammed then,
with horrible barbarity, ordered their hands and their feet to be
cut off, and the hands and feet of their slaves, and had them,
still living, dragged out into the court-yard of the palace,
where they lay till they died.</p>
<p><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>&ldquo;These ghastly crimes, more ghastly than ever in
a country where wilful bloodshed is so unusual, seem to have
struck terror far and wide, and no one has since dared to raise a
hand against Mohammed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knowledge of these terrible doings naturally made the
travellers feel that they were venturing into dangerous quarters
as they rode up to the gates of Hail.&nbsp; The Emir, whose title
was Mohammed-ibn-Rashid (Mohammed, son of Rashid), however,
received them kindly; and it was discovered that, apart from the
bloody work of the succession, he had turned out to be not a bad
ruler.&nbsp; In any part of his dominions, it was understood that
a person might travel unarmed, and with any amount of gold on
him, without fear of molestation.&nbsp; Moreover, he seemed to
have been deeply stricken with remorse for his past misdeeds,
lived in constant fear of assassination, and was endeavoring to
make what amends he could by lavishing honors and kindness on the
youth Na&iuml;f, the only one of his nephews he had
spared&mdash;for Bedr, too, had been executed.</p>
<p>It all reads much like a tale from the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights;&rdquo; and that Arabia is still the land of romance and
poetry is confirmed by a curious bit of news learned of Obeyd,
about whom it will be remembered Mr. Palgrave had also a good
deal to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He (Obeyd) lived to a great age, and died only nine
years ago (<i>i.e.</i> 1869).&nbsp; It is related of him that he
left no property behind him, having given away everything during
his lifetime&mdash;no property but his sword, his mare, and his
young wife.&nbsp; These he left to his nephew
Mohammed-ibn-Rashid, the reigning <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>Emir, with the request that his
sword should remain undrawn, his mare unridden, and his wife
unmarried forever after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The travellers give an interesting account of the Emir&rsquo;s
horses, the most famous stud in Nejd.</p>
<p>Though interested, they were, on the whole, disappointed with
the horses of Nejd as compared with those of Northern
Arabia.&nbsp; &ldquo;In comparing what we see here with what we
saw last year in the north, the first thing that strikes us is
that these are ponies, the others horses.&nbsp; It is not so much
the actual difference in height, though there must be quite three
inches on an average, as the shape, which produces this
impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The average height was found to be under fourteen hands; and
though great care was taken to obtain and preserve pure strains
of blood, in the matter of feeding and grooming, gross negligence
seemed to be the rule, even in the royal stud.&nbsp; The stables
were mere open yards, in which the animals stood, each tethered
to a manger.&nbsp; No shelter was provided, but each horse was
protected by a heavy rug.&nbsp; They wore no headstalls, being
fastened solely with ropes or chains about the fetlocks.&nbsp; No
regular exercise was given them, their food was almost
exclusively dry barley, and their appearance generally was far
different from what Europeans would naturally expect of the
finest stable of horses in the &ldquo;horse peninsula.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The travellers also enlighten us, on the subject of horses, in
other directions.&nbsp; Except in the north, horses were found to
be exceedingly rare.&nbsp; It is <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>possible to travel vast distances
without meeting a single horse, or even crossing a horse-track;
on the whole journey across the Nef&ucirc;d, and on to the
Euphrates, they scarcely saw a horse, apart from the stables of
the rich and great in the cities.&nbsp; The horse is a luxury to
be afforded only by people of wealth or position.&nbsp; Journeys
and raids and wars are all made on camels; the Sheykhs who have
horses, when going to war save them to mount at the moment of
actual engagement with the enemy.&nbsp; It was considered a great
boast by a Nejd tribe of Bedouins that they could mount one
hundred horsemen; while the Muteyr tribe, reputed to be the
greatest breeders of thoroughbred stock in Central Arabia, would
be expected to muster not more than four hundred mares.</p>
<p>Mohammed-ibn-Rashid recruited his stables by compelling the
Sheykhs of tributary tribes to sell him their best animals, an
improvement on some of his predecessors, who kept their studs up
to the proper mark becoming Arab royalty by making raids against
the tribes for the purpose of bringing in celebrated mares,
waiving the matter of payment.</p>
<p>In the spring the horses of the Emir&rsquo;s stables are
distributed among the neighboring Bedouins to be pastured on the
Nef&ucirc;d, which at that period affords excellent
grazing.&nbsp; Had the visitors seen the herd after a month on
the Nef&ucirc;d, they would likely have carried away a much more
favorable impression.&nbsp; During the winter quartering the
colts seemed to fare even worse than their dams and sires, from
the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides the full-grown animals, Ibn Rashid&rsquo;s <a
name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>yards
contain thirty or forty foals and yearlings, beautiful little
creatures, but terribly starved and miserable.&nbsp; Foals bred
in the desert are poor enough, but those in town have a
positively sickly appearance.&nbsp; Tied all day long by the
foot, they seem to have quite lost heart, and show none of the
playfulness of their age.&nbsp; Their tameness, like that of the
&lsquo;fowl and the brute,&rsquo; is shocking to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contrast between the actual treatment of these royal
animals and the following Arab recipe for rearing a colt is
sufficiently striking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the first month of his life let him be content
with his mother&rsquo;s milk; it will be sufficient for
him.&nbsp; Then, during five months, add to this natural supply
goats&rsquo; milk, as much as he will drink.&nbsp; For six months
more give him the milk of camels, and besides a measure of wheat
steeped in water for a quarter of an hour and served in a
nose-bag.&nbsp; At a year old the colt will have done with milk;
he must be fed on wheat and grass, the wheat dry from a nose-bag,
the grass green, if there is any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At two years old he must work or he will be
worthless.&nbsp; Feed him now, like a full-grown horse, on
barley; but in summer let him also have gruel daily at
mid-day.&nbsp; Make the gruel thus: Take a double-handful of
flour and mix it in water well with your hands till the water
seems like milk, then strain it, leaving the dregs of the flour,
and give what is liquid to the colt to drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful, from the hour he is born, to let him stand
in the sun; shade hurts horses; but let him have water in plenty
when the day is hot.&nbsp; The colt <a name="page295"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 295</span>must now be mounted and taken by his
owner everywhere with him, so that he shall see everything and
learn courage.&nbsp; He must be kept constantly in exercise, and
never remain long at his manger.&nbsp; He should be taken on a
journey, for the work will fortify his limbs.&nbsp; At three
years old he should be trained to gallop; then, if he be true
blood, he will not be left behind.&nbsp; Yalla!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Blunt thinks this represents a traditional practice of
rearing colts in Arabia since the days of the Prophet
Mohammet.</p>
<p>From Hail, the party joined the Haj, or caravan of Persian
pilgrims, returning home from Mecca and Medina; and after
eighty-four days&rsquo; travel from Damascus their Arabian
journey came to an end at Bagdad.&nbsp; Their route from Hail
took them far north of Palgrave&rsquo;s route, so that they did
not visit Ri&rsquo;ad, the headquarters, in Palgrave&rsquo;s
time, of the Wahabee ruler Feysul.&nbsp; Lady Blunt, however, in
an appendix to her narrative enlightens us in regard to the end
of Feysul, and the continued decline of the Wahabee regime after
the visit of Palgrave.</p>
<p>Three years after Palgrave&rsquo;s visit Feysul died, and the
Wahabee state, which under him had regained much of its power and
influence (which had been all but crushed by the Turks after the
Crimean war) was again weakened by internal dissensions.&nbsp;
Feysul left two sons, Abdallah and Saoud, who quarrelled and put
themselves at the head of their respective adherents.&nbsp; Saoud
proved himself the stronger party, and in 1871 Abdallah fled to
Jebel Shammar <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>and sought the aid of Midhat Pasha, Turkish governor at
Bagdad.</p>
<p>The result was that a Turkish expedition of 5,000 regular
troops occupied the seaboard territory of Hasa, and took
possession of Hofhoof (mentioned by Palgrave); whilst Abdallah
and his adherents, and a third rival, Abdallah-ibn-Turki,
attacked Saoud at Ri&rsquo;ad.&nbsp; Saoud was defeated, and
Abdallah essayed to govern at Ri&rsquo;ad; but in the following
year he was again ejected by Saoud who reigned till 1874, when he
died, not without suspicion of poison.</p>
<p>Lady Blunt&rsquo;s account of affairs at the Wahabee capital
ends with the information that Abdallah and a half-brother,
Abderrahman, were in joint and amicable control, Abdallah as
Emir, the latter as his chief minister.&nbsp; Hasa and the
seaboard was held by the Turks, whose policy was the stirring up
of strife and feudal enmity among the Arabs, with a view to
weakening the power and authority of the Emir at Ri&rsquo;ad, and
so making the country easy prey whenever opportunity arrives for
its incorporation in the Ottoman dominions.&nbsp; The power and
fanaticism of the once powerful Wahabee Empire, has become but
little more than a name and a remembrance among the Bedouin
tribes, who once paid tribute to its Emirs; and whatever was
national in thought and respectable in inspiration in Central
Arabia seemed to be grouping itself around the new dynasty of the
Emir of Jebel Shammar, Mohammed-ibn-Rashid of Hail.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
